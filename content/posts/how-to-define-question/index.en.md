Defining a problem is the first and most crucial step in solving it. If the problem is not clearly defined, it's impossible to make effective decisions, let alone produce excellent products and solutions. As Einstein said:
> **Posing a problem is more important than solving one.**
## What is a Problem?
A problem is essentially a contradiction or mismatch between things. It has the following characteristics:
1.  **Universality**
    -   Problems are everywhere; they are a universal phenomenon in the objective world.
2.  **Fluidity**
    -   Problems are not static; they change with time and environment. A current problem may no longer be a problem in the future, or it may evolve into a new one.
    -   The key aspects of a problem differ at various stages, and metrics can reflect these dynamic changes.
3.  **Self-Containment**
    -   A problem usually exists within a larger system of problems and can often be broken down into multiple sub-problems. It is crucial to select problems that are suitable and solvable.
4.  **Measurability**
    -   The severity of a problem can be quantified through data, metrics, and other means, which helps us better understand the problem.
5.  **Interrelatedness**
    -   Problems may be interrelated or have causal relationships. It's necessary to consider their fundamental propositions from a holistic perspective to avoid looking at them in isolation.

## How to View/Discover Problems?
Discovering problems is a systematic process that requires analysis and thinking from multiple dimensions. Here is a basic framework for discovering problems:
### Core Concepts
> - **Every noun has a structure.**
> - **Every verb has a process.**
> - **Every adjective is measurable.**
### Steps to Discover Problems
1.  **Phenomenon/New Concept (Structure)**
    -   Start with an observed phenomenon or a new concept and analyze the underlying structure and logic.
    -   Think: What is the essence of this phenomenon? What are its constituent elements?
2.  **Side Effects of Existing Solutions & Multi-dimensional Thinking (Insight, History)**
    -   Analyze the limitations and side effects of current solutions.
    -   Draw on historical experience and combine multi-dimensional perspectives (e.g., technological, economic, social) to uncover deeper insights.
3.  **Organize Metrics (Measure the Severity of the Problem, Present)**
    -   Define and organize key metrics to measure the severity and scope of the problem's impact.
    -   Metrics can help us clearly understand the current state of the problem and provide a basis for subsequent decisions.
4.  **Discover Opportunities (Essence)**
    -   Look for potential opportunities within the problem to find its essence and core pain points.
    -   Think: What is the underlying need behind this problem? How can it be transformed into an innovation?
5.  **Planning (Future)**
    -   Based on the understanding and analysis of the problem, develop a solution or improvement plan.
    -   The plan should be forward-looking to ensure it is proactive and sustainable.

## Summary
Defining a problem is the prerequisite for solving it. Only by clearly defining the problem can we make the right decisions and take effective action. By understanding the characteristics and essence of problems and applying a systematic way of thinking, we can better discover, analyze, and ultimately solve them.
Remember: **A problem is not an obstacle, but a starting point for innovation and progress.**
<!-- A contradiction usually has a parent contradiction and a child contradiction (the problem that the team lead's lead needs to solve) -->
<!-- The two sides of a contradiction are in motion, and this motion can be influenced. Intervention can reduce or increase the severity of the consequences brought by the contradiction. -->
<!-- 4. Specificity: In similar systems with the same conflicting parties, the nature of the contradiction can be different. This is specifically reflected in the different demands for metrics at different development stages of similar systems. -->
<!-- 5. Interrelatedness: Within the same system, different contradictions may have a causal relationship. This requires everyone to learn first-principles thinking (any system has a basic proposition that cannot be violated or deleted).

<!-- ## Describing the Problem
Core outcomes: Engineering, Platformization, Intelligence
Scenario-based solutions at scale (contradiction between business development level and technological efficiency)
Insufficient user experience, intelligent experience for person-to-person, human-computer, and human-object interactions (contradiction between self-service and unattended service)
Improving R&D efficiency (infrastructure for client, cloud, tools, etc., proportion of low-code solutions, cross-domain and cross-platform integration)

## Key Concepts
Architecture design is part of system design.
System design includes: business requirements, requirements analysis, business modeling, system analysis.
System design includes these questions:
Dimension |  Question | Definition ｜ Example
---------|----------|---------|---------
 Nature | Is this matter compliant and legal? | System Risk ｜Passenger personal safety
 Audience | Who is the ultimate beneficiary of this matter? | System Subject ｜Client, Supplier
 Benefit | What benefits will this bring upon completion? | System Value ｜Wonderful travel memories, advancing space technology (enhancing client benefits is the core goal of an architect)
 Objective | What kind of thing are we trying to achieve? | System Positioning ｜Mars travel
 Requirement | How can this matter be reasonably enumerated? | System Modeling ｜Personal safety / Good food / Good sleep
 Abstraction | How can the main thread of this matter be clearly explained? | System Architecture ｜Business modeling / Conceptual modeling / System architecture
 Design | What tools should be chosen to implement this? | System Construction ｜Technology selection
 Direction | Does this matter deviate from our original intention? | System Validation ｜Verification testing
### Model Building
Business Modeling: Describing the objects and elements involved in a business, as well as their attributes, behaviors, and relationships, using a software model.
Conceptual Model: Using a set of concepts to describe a system, or any alternative form to describe concepts, in order to further understand or explain how things work.
After building a model, complex business requirements are structured into simple business concepts, forming a consensus within the team, eliminating ambiguity, and ensuring information is transmitted without distortion. This provides a foundation for outputting the architecture.
Modeling Methods: Use-case driven (from outside in), Domain-driven (from inside out, layered, building a domain model)

<!-- Unclear problem definition leads to poor results.
Einstein: Posing a problem is more important than solving one. -->
<!-- Insight and common sense should be distinguished: Insight is a new idea or perspective. -->
<!-- A proposition can be broken down into two propositions: What is a problem? How to define it?
When you see a noun, you should know its structure; when you see a verb, its process; when you see an adjective, how to measure it. -->
<!-- What is a problem:
A problem is a contradiction (mismatch) of things - Mao Zedong
Three major values (customer value, social value, business value). Decisions are made to expand or narrow the contradiction. -->
<!-- After repeated simplification, 7 characteristics of a contradiction remain:
1. Universality: Contradictions are universally present in any system, with society being one such system.
2. Wholeness: A contradiction is part of a system, coming from the same system or from a system and its subsystem respectively.
3. Fluidity: The two sides of a contradiction are in motion, and this motion can be influenced. Intervention can reduce or increase the severity of the consequences brought by the contradiction.
4. Specificity: In similar systems with the same conflicting parties, the nature of the contradiction can be different. This is specifically reflected in the different demands for metrics at different development stages of similar systems.
5. Interrelatedness: Within the same system, different contradictions may have a causal relationship. This requires everyone to learn first-principles thinking (any system has a basic proposition that cannot be violated or deleted).

6. Self-containment: A contradiction usually has a parent contradiction and a child contradiction (the problem that the team lead's lead needs to solve).
7. Measurability: The severity of a contradiction should be measurable. -->
<!-- Contradictions shift over time. -->
<!-- Existing solutions/patch solutions may have side effects; solutions need to be explored from the basic proposition (first principles). -->
<!-- What are metrics? Metrics measure the severity of a contradiction. The evaluation system for the supply-demand contradiction (from the user's perspective):
Quality metrics (related to retention), demand throughput per unit of time, response time per demand, cost per demand.
Measurement methods drilled down by dimension: -->
Column A | data-type demand | information-type demand | Insight-type demand
---------|----------|---------|---------
 Quality of customer demand | B1 | C1 |
 Throughput of customer demand | B2 | C2 |
 Customer waiting time for demand | B3 | C3 |
 Cost per demand | B3 | C3 |
<!--

 User | Acquisition/Activation/Retention | C1 |
 Traffic Distribution | B2 | C2 |

The fluidity of contradictions is reflected in the metrics.
