## What is A11Y?

Accessibility (often abbreviated to A11y — as in “a” then 11 characters then “y”) in Web development means enabling as many people as possible to use Web sites, even when those people's abilities are limited in some way.

网络开发中的可访问性（通常缩写为 A11y--如 "a "然后是 11 个字符然后是 "y"）意味着使尽可能多的人能够使用网站，即使这些人的能力在某些方面受到限制。
