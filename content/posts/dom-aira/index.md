## What is A11Y?

**Accessibility** (often abbreviated to **A11y** — as in “a” then 11 characters then “y”) in web development refers to enabling as many people as possible to use websites, even when those people's abilities are limited in some way.

- **Key Concept**: A11y ensures that websites are usable by individuals with disabilities, including visual, auditory, motor, or cognitive impairments.
- **Goal**: To create inclusive digital experiences that accommodate all users, regardless of their physical or cognitive limitations.

## Knowledge Mapping 知识图谱

Below are essential resources for understanding and implementing web accessibility:

### 1. W3C Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI)
The **Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI)** develops strategies, guidelines, and resources to make the Web accessible to people with disabilities.

- **Website**: [W3C WAI Guidelines](https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/)

### 2. WAI-ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications)
**WAI-ARIA** defines a way to make dynamic web content and applications more accessible to people with disabilities.

- **Specification**: [WAI-ARIA Specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/)
- **Purpose**: Provides roles, states, and properties to enhance the accessibility of interactive and dynamic content.

### 3. HTML Accessibility (HTML-ARIA)
This document describes how to use ARIA roles and attributes in conjunction with HTML to improve accessibility.

  - Ensure sufficient color contrast.
  - Provide alternative text for images.
  - Make interactive elements keyboard-navigable.
  - Test your website with screen readers and other assistive technologies.
