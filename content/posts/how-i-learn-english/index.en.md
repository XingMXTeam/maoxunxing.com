I started learning English from primary school to university, and I believe that most university students are like me, because traditional Chinese education attaches importance to reading and comprehension of English, but basically it is dumb English.

I recalled my English learning journey, reciting the New Concept English in high school, and after I passed Grade 4 and 6 in college in one go with my high school accumulation, I never took the initiative to learn English reading again.
I never took the initiative to learn to read English again, but later I joined an English club and practised speaking like crazy. I can say that after graduation was the peak of my English, and I did not study English for 5 years after I started working.
I did not study English and did not speak it.

During my 6th year of work, I had to communicate with some foreign friends in Pakistan in English because of a project
I was barely able to understand, but my ability to express myself was limited and I found that my spoken English was really bad. . 

I then signed up for a private lesson in spoken English with Acasol for tens of thousands of dollars.
The first trial lesson was good, but then I basically didn't take many lessons because of my social phobia, which yielded very little results, and then intermittently.

This is basically my English learning journey. I'm sure there are many people like me.

So, how do I learn English now and is it still necessary to learn English?

{{<notice type="info">}}
First of all, I don't think it's necessary to put a lot of effort into learning English, because nowadays English is not a bottleneck and there are many ways to communicate
{{< /notice>}}
For example, even if I can't communicate in English, it doesn't stop me from talking to foreigners about project requirements, with the help of the nail tool you can just speak Chinese and if you really need to communicate in person.
You just need to know the noun + verb and assemble it, or throw a document on the line to collaborate.

So really the purpose of learning English is not because of a practical need, but a need for our self-worth.

Being able to speak English fluently is a sign of confidence.

There are so many ways to learn English these days, you can buy classes (which I don't think are necessary) or watch videos, but I don't think any of them are very effective.
The most important thing is to speak. Keep talking. Communicate in English as your first language in any online space and make a game out of speaking English.

**I always believe that consistent practice in the right direction will reveal the great rewards that the compounding of time gives you**

Here are a few tools I recommend to you. Today there is a spurt of big model AI applications, especially as the threshold for learning spoken English has become particularly low.


## Listening ★★★★★

Listening is very important! Because native English has a lot of alliteration, often you don't understand what it's saying, so listen more. Even if you don't know the words, listen more and you'll know what she's saying!!!
A tool for videos that works very well: [ChatGPT Assistant and YouTube/Netflix Dual Subtitles](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ai-translator-and-youtube/mjdbhokoopacimoekfgkcoogikbfgngb?hl=zh-CN)
It has a very good practice mode where you can pause the video and then practice listening over and over again.

## Say ★★★★

The first tool I would recommend is: CallAnnie This is a speaking practice tutor app. because she is actually the big model behind her not a real person, so you don't have to worry about social phobia. You can communicate with her on any topic at:
{{< img src="img.png" alt="call annie" maxWidth="960px" align="center" caption="Introducing call annie" >}}
Currently there is only the ios version, you can go to [official website](https://callannie.ai/) to download it, because the Chinese app store is not on the shelves, you can read this blog post
[How to register an App Store US account](/zh-cn/appleid-us-register/), the registration process is very simple 10 minutes to get it done.


One bad thing about CallAnnie is that it won't communicate your grammar (or I haven't found out how to use it yet). If you have any left at home, check out this [Speak](https://www.speak.com/), another speaking practice tutor app.

Optional additional tools:
[quazel](https://chat.quazel.com/home), which talks to the AI model and will correct your grammar
[tandem](https://www.tandem.net/zh-hans) real native social conversations, I've tried it, you can find the kind that is particularly enthusiastic and works well, I even added a foreign friend~~.
discord channel: https://discord.gg/english

The tools are there, then you can have fun and write once a day with your newly learned words or phrases (new words or phrases can be found from video bloggers, speaking books, movies for the most commonly used phrases), and
Then use the phrases or words you've learned to talk and communicate with various tools to practice.

**It is not important to have more tools, but to practice for 10-20 minutes a day.**


## Reading ★★★

Reading can be trained sometime, as an enhancement. Recommended reading pages or e-books that I highlight: [Immersive Translation](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/immersive-translate/bpoadfkcbjbfhfodiogcnhhhpibjhbnh?hl=zh-CN )
Primarily to do comparative translations of passages between Chinese and English for web pages or e-books.

And that's it.
