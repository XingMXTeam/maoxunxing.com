Last week, I attended a conference and benefited greatly from it. Here are some important lessons I learned from the speech of a high-level engineer who is about to leave Alibaba Group. He has not only made significant achievements in the technical field but also had a profound impact on the company. His sharing gave me a deeper understanding of how to learn better, cooperate with colleagues, and promote product success.

## 1. **Better master things, understand more**
To truly master a piece of knowledge or a skill, you usually need to go through the following four stages: **remember it, understand it, express it, and use it**.
### Memory
- **Types of Memory**: Memory is divided into short-term memory and long-term memory. Image memory is one of the most effective ways to remember.
- **Methods**:
  - Deepen memory through physical means (such as handwritten notes).
  - Repetition is the key to consolidating memory.
  
### Understand
- **Abstraction and Connection**: Computer science is an abstraction of real life. To better understand concepts, try to connect them with real life. For example, explain complex concepts with simple examples.
- **Broad Learning**: Learn as much as you can about related fields to broaden your horizons.
### Express
- **Test Your Mastery**: If you can clearly express a concept with simple and easy-to-understand examples, it means you have mastered it.
- **Clear Communication**: Ensure your expression can be easily understood by others.
### Use
- **In-depth Practice**: The ultimate goal is to apply the learned knowledge to practical problems, using it simply but profoundly.
- **Avoid Relying on External Tools**: Google is not a panacea. Only by internalizing knowledge in your own mind can you retrieve and use it quickly and flexibly.
- **Structure Knowledge**: Organize knowledge into an indexable and orderly form for easy retrieval at any time.
> **The greatest happiness comes from the greatest pain.**  
> Profound learning is often accompanied by challenges, but it is these challenges that make us grow.

## 2. **Best coding skills, become an expert**
Becoming an excellent programmer is not just about writing code; it requires effort in many aspects. Here are the key points:
### Core Principles
- **Think more, think often**: Constantly reflect on and optimize your way of thinking.
- **Pursue Excellence**: Always maintain high standards and strive to make the product better.
- **Love Programming**: Cultivate a passion for programming and spend more time on coding practice.
### Way of Thinking
- **Interdisciplinary Thinking**: Connect programming problems with other fields such as philosophy and psychology. For example:
  - If you want to remember `Object` methods, you can think of philosophical questions like "Who am I? Where do I come from? Where am I going?"
- **Continuous Improvement**: Never be satisfied with the status quo, but constantly break through yourself.
### Practical Advice
Following these three points can help you improve your coding skills:
1. **Read excellent code resources**: Learn from the design ideas in open-source projects or classic codebases.
2. **Communicate with excellent people**: Learn from the top talents in the industry and absorb their experience and wisdom.
3. **Maintain a mindset of excellence**: Always pay attention to details and adhere to high-quality work standards.

## 3. **Best communication skills**
### Avoid the XY Problem
#### What is the XY Problem?
Suppose someone asks you: "How do I get to the train station?"  
You might answer: "First go to Train Station No. 1, transfer at XX station, and then take a bus to your destination."  
But in reality, what this person really wants is to buy a train ticket, because he comes from a rural area and thinks he must go to the train station in person to buy a ticket. This is a typical XY problem:
- **Problem X**: The user's real need (to buy a ticket).
- **Problem Y**: The superficial question the user asks (how to get to the train station).
#### Solution
- When communicating with colleagues or users, first clarify the essence of the problem instead of directly solving the superficial issue.
- Ask about the other person's true intention and confirm which scope the problem belongs to:
  - User problem scope?
  - Product scope?
  - Technical scope?
  - Business scope?
> **The core of communication is to find the root of the problem, not to dwell on the surface.**

## 4. **Make Your Product Successful**
### Define the Problem Scope
As mentioned in Part 3, you first need to clarify the scope of the problem:
- Is it a user problem?
- Is it a product feature problem?
- Is it a technical implementation problem?
- Or is it a business logic problem?
### Elements of Product Success
1. **Focus on a single problem**: A product can only solve one problem, and it must directly address a human need.
   - Fear: The core driving force of security products.
   - Happiness: The pleasant experience brought by social products.
   - Vanity: Such as luxury goods or show-off products.
2. **Find supporters**: Find a strong sponsor or supporter for your product; this is a prerequisite for starting a project.
3. **Craftsmanship**: Treat the product as your own label and handle every detail with an attitude of excellence.
4. **Go beyond KPIs**: Don't just see the product as a tool to complete a task, but give it life and value.
> **Your product is your business card; patience and focus are the cornerstones of success.**

## Conclusion
This conference made me realize that whether it's learning new knowledge, improving coding skills, enhancing communication techniques, or building a successful product, it all requires systematic thinking and continuous effort. I hope the content above can provide some inspiration and help everyone make greater progress in their respective fields.
