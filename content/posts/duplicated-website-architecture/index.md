| Network                                 | VPC                                 | Virtual Private Cloud Virtual Private Cloud. Why Virtual Private? It is a collection of resources that run on a public cloud, isolating a portion of the public cloud resources for a particular user, and giving that user private access to resources that feel like they are using their own private cloud. What is a cloud? A virtualized network built on top of a physical one, VPCs use tunneling technology to isolate the virtual network. Each VPC has an individual tunnel number, and one tunnel number corresponds to one virtualized network. It consists of a private network segment (subnet) + a router (total entry) + a switch (further cut). |

### Distributed architecture theory

> What you need to know about distributed architecture Theory

Consistency theory

- CAP (Strong Consistency)
- ACID (Distributed Consistency)
- Base (Weak Consistency)
  - [Distributed consensus theory](http://thesecretlivesofdata.com/raft/)

Consistency algorithm

CALM->CRDT->Highly Available Transactions + ZAB Protocol Analysis->Paxos Raft Gossip

### Distributed Applications

> What are the distributed applications

File system: HDFS FastDFS Ceph mooseFS
[compare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_distributed_file_systems?spm=ata.21736010.0.0.30f21d02woZ6di)  
Database: Hbase (columnar storage), Elasticsearch/mongodb (document storage), redis (kv type), spanner (relational)  
Compute: offline hadoop real-time spark streaming storm/flink/blink  
cache: persistent redis non-persistent memcache  
messaging: kafka rabbitmq rocketmq activemq  
Monitoring: zookeeper  
Applications: hsf dubbo  
logs: collect flum, store elasticsearch/solr sls, locate zipkin  
Ledger: bitcoin ethereum

**Application Scenarios**.

- asynchronous calls
  - improve qps capacity e.g. real time live room
- Application decoupling
  - order system->message system->stock system(push or pull)
- Traffic control
  - spike activity/group buy
- Log processing
  - client->kafka queue->application log synchronization
- subscription
  - point to point / pub sub mode like IM
- Broadcast mode cache synchronization

Examples.

- high capability and persistence : Active MQ, Rabbit MQ, Rocket MQ
  - question is consistency questions?
    - use db and message queue to ensure final consistency
- client/zookeeper/kafka/storm clusterf
- JMS
  - EJB J2EE
  - Message mode(p2p/pub sub), Message Consume(async sync )

How to avoid message loss.

- TCP cannot ensure application no lost \* sync
- sync
  - wait confirm
  - continue ARQ(slide window)
- async
  - callback function

Message idempotency.

- query/delete: no special handle
- unique index
  - avoid dirty data
- token(token+redis/jvm memory)
  - avoid repeat submit
  - token need to apply, only one time
    - 1 apply token
    - 2 submit and to check token, if delete success that token exsit
- Pessimistic lock
  - query with
- optimistic lock
  - update with
- distributed lock
  - if system is distributed, it is hard to build unique index. userid_suffix as key to get distributed lock(multiple threads concurrent lock)
- select+insert
  - when concurrent not high, we can use this
  - search data, if exsit, not run next

ensure that the message is in order (queue not in order but the message is in order)

- sender: async send message, if 1 failed, you need to resend, cannot promise order
- You cannt split the message to different messages:
  - you cannt split message to different queue
  - if you have only one queue, how to promise order if a machine unavailable, you can switch to another machine(when message is not consumed)
    _ sync copy to promise the order
    sync copy to promise the order _ receiver
  - sync consume

### Distributed caching

> How to solve distributed caching problems

Data flow
{{< img src="data-flow.png" alt="data-flow" maxWidth="600px" >}}

Using middleware middleware

**Redis**.

- why is it fast
  - use memory
  - non-blocking multiplexing io
  - single thread
- Application Scenarios
  - sorted set( top N, range find, delay task, )
  - set(remove duplicated, common and unique things)
  - list(message queue, pagination)
  - hash(single point login)
  - string(count cache)
- memory policy
  - delete regularly and randomly
  - lazy delete when get key
  - memory elimination
- progressive hashing (rehashing)
- cache penetration
  - How to solve
  - how to solve
    - bitmap
    - empty value to cache
- cache avalanche
  - expire time randomly
  - limit flow
  - distributed lock

### Distributed database

Read-write separation: data is written to the master and read from the standby (data is replicated to the master)  
Vertical splitting: different business units are divided into different databases. ACID is broken; Join operation is difficult; foreign key constraints are affected
Horizontal table splitting: single table split (e.g. ugc table is very large) Self-incrementing primary key is affected; single table query becomes multi-table

Application scenarios.  
1 Read-write separation  
2 library splitting and table splitting  
3 Dynamic data source  
4 Master-standby switching

### Distributed Scheduling

schedulerX

### Distributed search

Open Search

### Distributed transactions

TXC(Taobao Transaction Constructor)

### Distributed Computing

**blink**: Distributed real-time computing  
**odps** (Open Data Processing Service): Distributed offline computing Storage and computation of structured data, massive data warehouse solutions and big data analysis and modeling

- web: service provisioning
- sdk: packaging api
- clt: client-side tools, submit commands
- ide: visualization operations

## Big Data and High Concurrency

> What are the solutions for big data and high concurrency scenarios?

### bitmap

- Application scenario (data range below int\*10)

  - quick sort not repeated array
  - quick remove repeat
  - quick search
  - bloom filter (high Accuracy)
    - check url is the same

- advantage
  - less memory usage

### Flow limiting algorithm

- count number
- sliding window
- leaky bucket
- token bucket

### Load balancing

- dns
- reverse proxy
- http redirect
- Stratification

### Operations and Monitoring
