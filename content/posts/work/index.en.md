## Influence

If your product solves a problem, how do you persuade others? The key lies in telling your story well. Here, we introduce a classic theory—the **SCQA Model**, to help you structure your expression.

### **SCQA Model**
1. **S（Situation）Situation**  
   - Introduce from familiar situations or facts to establish a background for the audience.
2. **C（Complication）Complication**  
   - Describe the contradiction or conflict between the actual situation and expectations, creating suspense.
3. **Q（Question）Question**  
   - Asking a question: "What should we do facing such a conflict?"
4. **A（Answer）Answer**  
   - Providing a solution and clearly explaining its value and advantages.

> **Example**:  
> S: Our system processes millions of requests every day, and user performance requirements are becoming increasingly high.  
> C: However, the existing architecture often experiences delays during peak times, affecting user experience.  
> Q: How can we improve system performance and stability?
> A: We designed a completely new distributed caching architecture, successfully reducing latency by 50%.

Through this structured expression, information can be clearly conveyed and the audience can be moved.

## Promotion & Defense Key Points

In the workplace, solving problems does not necessarily lead to promotion, as promotion requires **recognition** and defense (face-to-face evaluation). Here are the key points:

### **Key Recognition Points**


#### **1. Proactive Principle**

- **Proactive Communication**: Regularly share work progress, ideas, and intentions, and listen to feedback and suggestions.
- **Proactive Reception**: Stay informed about business developments (such as launch performance, technical architecture changes), and identify gaps and improvements from a promotion perspective.
---

#### **2. Principles of Growth**
Continuously improve your skill points:
- **Solution Design → Architecture Design → System Optimization**  
  - Gradually take on more complex tasks, demonstrating your growth trajectory.

#### **3. Value Principle**
Align with personal business and job requirements to learn knowledge that is valuable to the company, ensuring your contributions align with company goals.

### **SOP (Standard Operating Procedure)**

1. Do well in the above three points, achieve results, and master the relevant skills.
2. Requirements for advancing to the next level.
3. Proactively take on work content for the next level and demonstrate competence in advance.

### **Key Evaluation Points**

#### **1. Self-introduction**
- Team and business area.
- Current level and promotion level.

#### **2. Current Responsibilities**
- Scope of business responsible for.
- Whether it involves leading a team and the team size.
- Key responsibilities of the role.

#### **3. Work Experience**
- Employment duration/Company name/Highest position.
- Project experience (up to three).

#### **4. Self-Introduction**
Adopt the **Pyramid Principle** (explain what, defense explain why):
- **What abilities were achieved?**
- According to the "What to Learn" chapter, select complex jobs that are strongly related to the competency model.
- Long duration, large scale, high uncertainty, certain challenges and innovation.
- **Core Argument**:
- Example: Responsible for the architecture design of a large-scale project, successfully improved system performance.
- **Supporting Arguments**:
  - Attending conferences, article sharing, virtual team leader, participating in open source, etc.

##### **STAR Model**
- **S (Situation)**: Summary nature (details when speaking).
- **T（Task）**：Focus on describing what you were responsible for and the role you played.
- **A（Action）**：The most core part, what you did (no need to write why you did it). Can use a diagram (architecture diagram, mind map) + a few key points to showcase.
- **R（Result）**：Efficiency, effectiveness, quality, cost. Combine tangible and intangible (quantitative + qualitative).
  - Example: Improved system performance, XX base increased from X to Y.
- First establish the base number, then calculate the ratio.
    - Use absolute values (from what to what, without expressing the ratio).
    - Related to money (cost).

#### **5. Self-Reflection + Development Plan**
- Define future development direction and demonstrate long-term value.
  - Example: Future plans include in-depth research on microservice architecture to further enhance system scalability and stability.


### **Defense Session**

#### **Distinguish Question Types**
- **What**：Matters + Results.
- **How**：Methods + Steps.
- **Why**：Principles + Thinking (from business and technical perspectives, "Solving Problems" chapter, systematic and in-depth thinking).

#### **Answering Principles**
- Don't say yes if you don't know, avoid excessive speculation.
- Be clear and concise in your answers, highlight the key points.

## **Skill Levels**

- **Basic**: Means being able to do something, able to complete basic tasks.
- **Proficient**: Means the ability to do something well, with high execution capabilities and quality assurance.
- **Mastery**: Means the ability to optimize something. Adopting different approaches, thinking, and tools to complete the same task and achieve breakthroughs. For example, introducing new technology into work also falls under the category of optimization.

## **COMD Model**

The COMD Model describes an individual's competency model from four levels of complexity and three dimensions.

### **Four Complexities**

1. **Scale Complexity**  
   - Involving lines of code, number of team members, number of features, number of stakeholders, number of systems, etc.
   - For example: managing a large distributed system or coordinating collaboration among multiple teams.

2. **Time Complexity**  
   - Need to plan long-term goals, such as a 3-year business plan.
   - For example: Develop a technical roadmap to ensure technology and business development are aligned.

3. **Environmental Complexity**
- Including changes in the external environment (policies, market, competitors) and changes in the technical environment (technology stack upgrades, tool chain updates).
   - For example: Maintaining technical leadership in a rapidly changing industry.

4. **Innovation Complexity**  
   - Manifested as innovation in theory, ideas, and techniques, divided into the following levels:
- **From 0 to 1**: Groundbreaking work, solving problems never encountered before.
     - **Architectural Refactoring**: Optimizing existing systems to enhance performance and maintainability.
     - **Project Solution Design**: Designing reasonable solutions to meet business requirements.
     - **Coding**: Efficiently implementing features while ensuring code quality and performance.

### **Three Dimensions**

Competence can be assessed from the following three dimensions:

1. **Technical**  
   - Technical depth and breadth, including mastery of programming languages, frameworks, algorithms, system design, and other aspects.

2. **Management**  
   - Abilities in team collaboration, resource allocation, project management, and leadership.

3. **Business**  
   - Understanding and driving business capabilities, including user needs analysis, market insights, and product design.

## **Wu Jun's Engineer Model**

According to the [Engineer Model](https://www.cnblogs.com/jsjwk/p/10954650.html) proposed by Wu Jun, an engineer's capabilities can be divided into five levels:

1. **Fifth Level: Can independently solve problems and complete engineering work**  
   - Possesses basic technical skills and can independently complete assigned tasks.

2. **Fourth Level: Capable of guiding and leading others to accomplish more impactful work**  
   - Not only able to work independently but also able to guide others and lead teams to complete complex projects.

3. **Third Level: Capable of independently designing and implementing products that achieve success in the market**  
   - Able to design and implement products from scratch and ensure their success in the market.

4. **Second Level: Ability to design and implement products that others cannot (his role is difficult to replace)**  
   - Possesses unique core competitiveness, capable of solving high-difficulty problems, and his contributions are hard to substitute.  

5. **First Level: Pioneering an industry**  
   - Pioneers entirely new fields or industries, with disruptive influence.

## How do you prove you're good at something?

Similar to "how do you prove you're rich," you can demonstrate whether you truly master a skill or knowledge through the following aspects:

1. **Comparison Ability**: Just as wealth is proven through comparing assets, you can showcase your professionalism by comparing your solutions with others.
2. **Quick Response**: When you are familiar with a field, you can quickly form a clear line of thought when facing related issues and describe the steps to solve the problem.
3. **Mental Map**: True mastery means having a complete knowledge map in your mind, able to quickly explain "one, two, three" in a logical order.

## Dimensions of a Person and Levels of Doing Things

### Dimensions of a Person
- **Reliable people**: Do things well, complete tasks.  
- **Professional people**: Cultivate themselves through their work, becoming experts in certain fields (driven by interest, physically diligent).  
- **Different people**: Vision-driven, create their own works (mentally diligent).  
- **Extraordinary people**: Determined, break through in thinking level and cognition (mentally diligent in terms of thinking framework).

### Levels of Doing Things  
1. **Level 5**: Independently solve problems and complete tasks.  
2. **Level 4**: Guide and lead others, accomplish influential work.  
3. **Level 3**: Independently design and complete products, achieve success in the market.
4. **Second Level**: Design and implement products that others cannot.  
5. **First Level**: Create an industry.  

- **Why**: Clarify the original purpose and meaning of what you do.  
- **How**: Develop a specific execution plan.
