## Framer Motion Usage Examples
Here are some common Framer Motion use cases and code examples:
### 1. Basic Animation Example
Implement a simple element fade-in effect:
```jsx
import { motion } from "framer-motion";
function App() {
  return (
    <motion.div
      initial={{ opacity: 0 }}
      animate={{ opacity: 1 }}
      transition={{ duration: 1 }}
    >
      Hello, Framer Motion!
    </motion.div>
  );
}
export default App;
```
### 2. Gesture Animation Example
Implement a draggable element:
```jsx
import { motion } from "framer-motion";
function App() {
  return (
    <motion.div
      drag
      style={{
        width: 100,
        height: 100,
        background: "blue",
      }}
    />
  );
}
export default App;
```
### 3. Layout Animation Example
Implement a dynamic add animation for list items:
```jsx
import { motion } from "framer-motion";
function App() {
  const [items, setItems] = useState([1, 2, 3]);
  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={() => setItems([...items, items.length + 1])}>
        Add Item
      </button>
      <ul>
        {items.map((item) => (
          <motion.li
            key={item}
            layout
            initial={{ opacity: 0 }}
            animate={{ opacity: 1 }}
            exit={{ opacity: 0 }}
          >
            Item {item}
          </motion.li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
}
export default App;
```

## AnimeJS Usage Examples
Here are some common AnimeJS use cases and code examples:
### 1. Basic Animation Example
Implement a simple element fade-in effect:
```javascript
anime({
  targets: '.box',
  opacity: [0, 1],
  duration: 1000,
  easing: 'easeInOutQuad'
});
```
### 2. Timeline Animation Example
Implement multiple elements appearing sequentially:
```javascript
const timeline = anime.timeline({
  easing: 'easeOutExpo',
  duration: 750
});
timeline
  .add({
    targets: '.box1',
    translateX: [100, 0],
    opacity: [0, 1]
  })
  .add({
    targets: '.box2',
    translateX: [100, 0],
    opacity: [0, 1]
  }, '-=500'); // Starts with a 500ms delay
```
### 3. Keyframe Animation Example
Implement a color gradient animation for an element:
```javascript
anime({
  targets: '.box',
  backgroundColor: [
    { value: '#FF0000', duration: 1000 },
    { value: '#00FF00', duration: 1000 },
    { value: '#0000FF', duration: 1000 }
  ],
  loop: true
});
```
### 4. SVG Animation Example
Implement an SVG path stroke animation:
```html
<svg width="100" height="100">
  <path id="path" d="M10 10 H 90 V 90 H 10 Z" fill="none" stroke="#000"></path>
</svg>
```
```javascript
anime({
  targets: '#path',
  strokeDashoffset: [anime.setDashoffset, 0],
  easing: 'easeInOutSine',
  duration: 2000,
  loop: true
});
```

## Summary
**Framer Motion** and **AnimeJS** are two powerful and easy-to-use animation libraries, each suited for different development scenarios:
- **Framer Motion**: Ideal for React-based projects, especially those requiring complex interactions and gesture support.
- **AnimeJS**: Suitable for lightweight projects or scenarios needing cross-platform support, particularly those with high demands for SVG and timeline animations.
Here are a few recommendations:
1. **Choose the right tool**: Select the appropriate animation library based on your project's requirements and tech stack.
2. **Prioritize basic animations**: Master basic animation features first and become familiar with animating common properties.
3. **Performance optimization**: Pay attention to the performance overhead of animations; avoid excessive DOM manipulation or complex calculations.
