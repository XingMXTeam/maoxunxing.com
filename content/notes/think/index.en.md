> The way to think about the future is to start from first principles. The way software will be written and used in the future will depend on machine learning, not manual coding. The best mentor is AI; be good at using chains of reasoning to solve problems. Example roles include AI Software Engineer, AI Designer, and AI Verification Engineer. First, think clearly about what problem you want to solve, then use AI to help you think and find ways to automate and scale. This requires creativity, determination, and the knowledge of how to break down problems.
> From Jensen Huang
## Ways of Thinking
### First Principles  
- An extension of deductive reasoning.  
- Start from principles, deduce step by step, and find methods and paths to solve problems.  
  - Example: Summarizing formulas.
### Structured Thinking  
Break down complex problems into clear structures for easier analysis and resolution.
### Multi-dimensional Thinking  
View problems from multiple perspectives to avoid the limitations of a single viewpoint.
### Dialectical Thinking: 6 Thinking Hats  
- **Tool**: Use the 6 Thinking Hats to view problems dialectically.  
- **Reference Course**: Wang Huiwen's Tsinghua Product Course.
## Expression, Value, and Details
### Being Capable vs. Being Articulate  
- **Articulate**: Weight (Expressive Ability).  
- **Capable**: Length (Execution Ability).  
- We be ourselves, also to help others better be themselves.
### Audience Analysis  
Is the audience the reading type or the listening type? Try different approaches during the first communication.  
- **Reporting Skills**:  
  - **1%**: Concise and to the point.  
  - **50%**: Moderately detailed.  
  - **99%**: Comprehensive and detailed.
### Expression and Value  
- Many people may just not know how to express themselves.  
- The significance of speaking up: to reshape others or to wear them down, the key is whether you can express yourself well.  
- Goal Setting: Set a goal for yourself to achieve "something from nothing." Let those who hear the cannons call for fire (goals from the bottom up), because the goal determines the direction of your work.
### User Value  
Even if you only solve a problem for one user, it is valuable to that user.
### Details and the Devil  
The devil is in the details. When you get caught up in the details, you will face the devil directly.
## How to Think  
- **Starting Point**: Start from the scenario, start from the value.  
- **Value Measurement**: What is your judgment?  
- **Path to Realization**: How to achieve the goal?
- **MindNode**: A mind mapping tool to help organize thoughts.
Don't study the methodologies of those who have never succeeded.

## Causal Science and Statistical Inference
### DDPP Paradigm  
- Categorical data, numerical data.  
- Berkson's paradox.
