## How to help a blind person build a brand?

Assuming this blind person has no skills, they can still find customers and build a brand through the following methods:

### 1. Define service positioning

- Identify service areas suitable for the blind, such as:  
  - Psychological listening services (the blind may be more skilled at listening and empathy).  
  - Handicrafts (such as weaving, massage, etc., tasks that do not require visual participation).  
  - Audio content creation (such as storytelling, recording audio courses).  

### 2. Craft a personal story

- Share your unique experiences and challenges to help customers feel a sense of authenticity and connection.  
- Example:  
  - “Though I cannot see the world, I hope to warm your heart with my voice.”  
  - “Every handmade item carries my passion for life.”

### 3. Leverage social networks for promotion

- Use your network of acquaintances (friends, family, community) to promote your official account.  
- Provide simple, shareable content (such as touching stories or practical tips) that customers will want to share with others.

### 4. Continuously produce valuable content

- Regularly update your official account content to maintain interaction with customers.  
- Content formats can include text, audio, and images (with assistance from others).  
- Examples:  
  - Share insights from daily life.  
  - Offer free mini-service experiences (such as a trial version of psychological counseling).

### 5. Gain customers' trust and recognition

- Brand building is based on **attention and recognition**, so it is important to serve every customer with care.  
- Expand influence gradually through word-of-mouth recommendations from customers.

## Real-life case inspiration

- **Blind massage therapists**: Many blind individuals have established their own brands by opening massage parlors. Customers come not only for the skill but also because they are moved by their efforts and perseverance.  
- **Blind live streamers**: Some blind individuals share their lives and tell stories through audio live streaming platforms, attracting a large following and forming their own brands.

## Summary

Zhang Xiaolong's statement that “even the smallest individual has their own brand” reflects a profound insight into the value of the individual. For blind individuals, even without traditional skills, they can establish their own brand by **finding their unique value**, **telling their own story**, and **leveraging social media**. WeChat Official Accounts serve as a tool to help them reach more customers, but what truly attracts customers is the sincerity and effort behind the brand.

This is not only an inspiration for the blind community but also a reflection on how every ordinary person can find their place in the digital age.
