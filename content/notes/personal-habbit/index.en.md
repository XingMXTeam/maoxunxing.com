Lu Qi once said a famous quote:

> "I can honestly tell everyone, if you treat the company's mission, the company's business, as your own personal business, **Own everything**, your career will definitely progress the fastest."

## Personal Understanding


- The most important quality for programmers is **self-taught**

---

- Dreams are an indispensable part of life, not only a longing for the future but also one's own expectations of oneself
- Entrepreneurship, at its core, is the desire for opportunity and the organizational ability to seize it; everything else is bullshit. As long as a company still has a strong desire for new opportunities and the ability to seize them, it has an entrepreneurial spirit.
- Completion is more important than perfection
- it is what you do that defines you
- Don't repeat yourself
## 1. Sense of Responsibility and Dependence

- **A strong sense of responsibility is the reason for dependence**:

  - A sense of responsibility is a powerful internal driving force.

- When you are responsible for something or someone, you may develop a sense of dependence, but this is not bad; it is an extension of a sense of responsibility.
## 2. Inner Strength
- **What is inner?**

  - Inner is your understanding of the world, the depth and breadth of your thoughts.

- **Inner richness makes you feel happy**:  
    - Inner growth not only helps you face external changes with more ease but also brings deep satisfaction.  
## 3. Take every opportunity seriously
- **Take every opportunity to interact with others seriously**:

- Every interpersonal interaction can bring unexpected value.

  - Don't underestimate any seemingly ordinary opportunity, as they could be significant turning points.
- **Treat important events seriously**:
  - If you approach work or life's matters casually, it's difficult to have a promising future.

- **To take it seriously and work hard**, that is the correct attitude.
## 4. Belief is the Cornerstone of Success
- **Faith（Belief）!**

  - Belief is the driving force that propels you forward.

- No matter how great the difficulties, firm belief can help you find direction and persevere to the end.
## 5. Abstract Thinking and Efficiency Improvement
- **Abstract Thinking**:

  - Abstract thinking can help you extract general solutions from complex problems.

- **Reuse**: Reduce repetitive work through abstract thinking, avoid unnecessary overtime.
## 6. Core Elements of Entrepreneurship
- **Entrepreneurship is not just about good ideas**:

  - Entrepreneurship requires a good team and execution.

- An excellent team and efficient execution capabilities are the key to entrepreneurial success.
## 7. Action and Uncertainty
- **Bias for Action（Emphasis on Action）**:

  - When facing choices, prioritize taking action rather than excessive hesitation.

- Action is the first step to solving problems.
- **Deal with Ambiguity（处理不确定性）**：
  - Life and work are full of uncertainty and unexpected situations.

  - Learning to adapt quickly to changes and make decisions in ambiguous environments is an important skill for growth.
"Not proactive, not rejecting, not taking responsibility" is a passive, neutral, and avoiding-responsibility state.
