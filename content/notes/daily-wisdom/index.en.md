> Life is like climbing stairs; each step has its own challenges. Studying physics has its challenges, and studying comics has its challenges.

## Mahjong Secrets

> @Hu Yan Luan Yi: Rather be cut a thousand times than win the first hand. If you don't play the 1 and 2 tiles, you'll suffer. If you don't play the 8 and 9 tiles, you'll lose everything. If you have four, don't play one; play the 2 and 5 first, then the 8. Don't break the edge, break the card, and call for the 50,000. Be careful with 1 and 4, and if you have a bar, use it. If the player below you plays 30,000 or 50,000, don't randomly play 40,000 or 70,000. If the player below you plays 10,000, be prepared for 20,000 or 50,000.

Everyone has flaws, but how we perceive and address these flaws determines the course of our lives. Instead of avoiding or denying them, we should confront them and turn them into motivation for growth. Remember: **Why should others prove your worth?** Enrich your inner world and live a life that is uniquely yours.

## 1. Accepting Your Imperfections

No one is perfect; flaws are part of who we are. Instead of being too hard on yourself, learn to accept them.  

- **Flaws are not a burden**; they are signals reminding us that there is room for improvement. 
- Accepting our shortcomings allows us to face life's challenges with greater composure.

> **Key point**: Flaws are not scary; what's scary is your attitude toward them. Accept them, and you can change them.

## 2. Turn flaws into positive energy

Flaws are not entirely useless; they can become the driving force propelling us forward.  

- **Afraid of failure?** This might be because you set high standards for yourself. Try to turn this “high standard” into motivation to pursue excellence.  
- **Not good at socializing?** This might indicate that you excel at deep thinking. Leverage this strength by focusing on tasks or creative work that require independent completion.  

> **Action suggestion**: List your flaws and find a corresponding strength for each one. You will discover that weaknesses can also become your unique strengths.  

## 3. Existence comes from within, not from others  

Often, we unconsciously rely on external validation to prove our worth. However, the truth is that **true existence comes from inner richness and fulfillment**.

- Do not let others' opinions define who you are.
- Learn to appreciate yourself and acknowledge your efforts and progress.  

> **Reflection question**: Do you often care about others' opinions? If so, try asking yourself, “What do I truly want?”

## 4. Enrich your inner world and live a more meaningful life

Enriching your inner world not only helps us better face our weaknesses but also makes life more interesting.

- **Cultivate hobbies**: Whether it's reading, sports, or artistic creation, find something that brings you joy.  
- **Continuously learn and grow**: Keep yourself curious and vibrant by learning new skills or exploring unknown areas.
- **Build positive relationships**: Connect with like-minded people and share your growth experiences.

> **Practical methods**: Spend a little time each day doing something that makes you happy, even if it's just reading a book or listening to music, to recharge your inner energy.

### Deep Reflection: The Meaning of Life for Everyone

  - Are there deeper needs or fears behind their actions?
