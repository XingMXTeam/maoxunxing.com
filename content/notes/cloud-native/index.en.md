{{< img src="devops.png" alt="devops" maxWidth="900px" caption="has circle" >}}
O&M Efficiency:
Serverless applications, BaaS (Backend as a Service) for backend services, fully managed, no O&M required
Decoupling of applications and infrastructure, middleware can be upgraded in one day
Unified FaaS platform, doubling R&D efficiency
Stability:
Always online
Cost:
Zero additional cost for promotional applications
Annual optimization of resource costs
Zero cost to move to the cloud
Scalability:
Unit-isolated configuration sharding, supporting a transaction capability of 1,000,000/s
Trusted Native
