I recently did a thorough study of Vercel, Firebase, and Cloudflare for the deployment platform of my new project. At first, I was quite torn, but after an in-depth comparison, I 毫不犹豫 ly chose Cloudflare without hesitation. Let me share my thought process with you—once you hear it, you might just be tempted to switch too.

#### First, its free plan, it completely blows the "ceiling" away

When we work on projects, we try to minimize startup costs. Vercel and Firebase's free tiers look decent, but compared to Cloudflare Pages, they seem a bit "stingy":

*   **Vercel:** 100GB of monthly free bandwidth.
*   **Firebase:** 10GB of monthly free bandwidth.
*   **Cloudflare:** **Unlimited traffic and request volume!**

This is the decisive factor. With Vercel or Firebase, I always have to worry about traffic consumption, afraid that a page might suddenly become popular or there are too many images, leading to a hefty bill. But with Cloudflare, it feels like driving a car that doesn't need fuel, giving me great peace of mind, allowing me to fully focus on product development instead of constantly monitoring the dashboard.

#### What truly made me make up my mind is the killer feature of "zero egress fees"

The term "egress fees," is the most deceptive hidden cost in all cloud platforms.

Let me give you an analogy: Vercel and Firebase are like shopping malls, where you store your "merchandise" (website data, images). When users visit and take these "merchandise" from the mall (i.e., download data), the mall charges a commission based on traffic. If your website has many images or offers file downloads, this "commission" can be surprisingly high.

**And Cloudflare's approach is to completely eliminate this rule.**

It's like telling you: "Take the merchandise freely, I won't charge a penny!" No matter how much your users download from the website, you don't have to pay this traffic fee. This strategy fundamentally solves the problem of skyrocketing costs after scaling, making it a literal lifesaver for any application that handles media content.

#### It's no longer just a simple CDN or static hosting

I used to think Cloudflare Pages could only host static pages, but that's completely not the case anymore. Its ecosystem is now very mature and can fully support complex dynamic applications:

*   **Backend Logic (Cloudflare Workers):** You can use it to handle API requests, user authentication, and all backend logic. The free tier offers 100,000 calls per day, with extremely high performance because the code runs on edge nodes worldwide, making user access incredibly fast.
*   **File Storage (Cloudflare R2):** This is the object storage that competes with AWS S3. Do you need users to upload avatars or attachments? R2 is the solution. The most critical point is that it also **has no egress fees**.
*   **Database (Cloudflare D1):** They even have their own serverless database. For many small and medium-sized applications, the functionality is sufficient, and the cost might be just a fraction of Firebase Firestore.

#### Of course, it's also objective to talk about Vercel and Firebase

My choice of Cloudflare doesn't mean the other two are bad, just that the scenarios are different:

*   **Vercel is still the "king of development experience"**: If you use Next.js and your team 追求极致的开发效率, then Vercel's seamless Git workflow and automatic preview deployments are definitely worth the money.
*   **Firebase is still the "full set for rapid development"**: If you want to quickly build an App that requires user login and real-time data synchronization (especially mobile Apps), Firebase's integrated solution can save you a lot of trouble with backend configuration.

#### My Conclusion

Overall, for the vast majority of projects seeking **ultimate cost-effectiveness**, **long-term development**, and **cost control**, Cloudflare is currently the most sensible choice.

It allows you to enter with almost zero cost, then uses a disruptive pricing model to ensure you won't be crushed by bills even after you grow. This sense of security is something Vercel and Firebase can't provide.

I genuinely recommend you give it a try—deploy your next project on Cloudflare and see for yourself. If you encounter any issues during the process, feel free to reach out to me anytime.
