> Life can't be as good as you imagine, but it also can't be as bad as you imagine. I think people's fragility and strength are beyond their own imagination. Sometimes, I might be so fragile that a single word can make me tear up, and sometimes, I also find that I've walked a long way gritting my teeth. ——Maugham's "Boule de Suif"


## Metadata

Before writing, briefly outline what you want to write and adjust your expression based on the different readers.  

- **Goal**: Make the content clear and easy to understand for readers with different backgrounds.  
- **Method**: For non-technical readers, try to explain complex concepts in simple language; for technical readers, you can delve into details appropriately.  

## Paragraph Structure

Each paragraph must have an opening sentence that clearly states the main idea of the paragraph.  

- **What do you want to express**: Clarify the topic.  

- **Why is this important**: Explain the significance or value.  
- **How should readers utilize this knowledge**: Provide practical application scenarios or suggestions.
## Sentence Principles

---

1. **Unity Principle**: Avoid expressing multiple ideas in a single sentence (e.g., "and this with and that").  

2. **Concise Expression**: Remove redundant words to ensure clarity.
## Jargon and Cognitive Context

- If professional terms or jargon are involved, provide a high-quality link pointing to the relevant explanation.  

- Assume the reader knows less than you do, avoid making beginners feel confused.  

- Example:  
  - Technical term: "JavaScript is a single-threaded language." → [What is single-threaded?](https://example.com)
- Non-technical term: "JavaScript can only do one thing at a time."
## Common Problems and Improvement Suggestions
---

### 1. Use fewer pronouns to avoid ambiguity

- Example:

- Error: "It runs very fast."

  - Correction: "The code runs very fast."
### 2. Avoid idioms
- Example:

---

- Error: "We kill two birds with one stone."
- Correction: "We solved two problems at the same time."
### 3. Express concisely

- Remove redundant expressions, such as "there exists one at some place" or "there exist multiple at some place."

- Example:  
  - Original sentence: "There are many overlaps between software and hardware."  
  - Revised: "Software and hardware have many overlaps."  
  - Original sentence: "There is no multithreading in JavaScript."
- Changed to: "JavaScript does not have multi-threading."

### 4. Use fewer adjectives and adverbs

- Examples:  
  - Incorrect: "In production mode, the code runs extremely fast."
- Correction: "In production mode, code execution efficiency will be improved by 225%."

### 5. Using Lists

- **Numbered List**: Used for steps or processes.  
- **Bulleted List**: Used for parallel content.

### 6. Maintain parallel list structure

All list items should be consistent:  

- **Grammar and punctuation**: Uniform formatting.  
- **Logical categorization**: Ensure list items belong to the same category.
- **Case Rule**: Maintain consistency.

#### Incorrect Example:

- c++
- JAVASCRIPT?
- Rust!
- Chocolate chip cookies

#### Correct example:

- C++
- JavaScript  
- Rust  
- Python  

### 7. Use the active voice

- Example:  
  - Error: "The story was written by me."  
  - Correction: "I wrote a story."

## Writing Tips

### Iterative Documentation

1. **Consistent Style**: Choose a formal, accurate, or conversational style based on the content.  

2. **Identify Target Audience**: Clearly define who your readers are and their background knowledge.  
3. **Take a Break Before Revising**: After writing, take a break and then review, even reading the article aloud.
4. **Find Partners for Proofreading**: Ask others to help check the article and identify potential issues.
### Document Organization

0. **Content Scope**: Clearly define what is included, what background knowledge readers need, and what is excluded.  

1. **Short Series of Articles is Better Than Long Articles**: Modular explanations are easier to understand.

2. **Theory + Practice**: Combine concepts with practical applications, demonstrating how to implement them.  
3. **Step-by-Step**: Progress from basic to advanced levels, expanding gradually.  
4. **Table of Contents**: It's best to provide a table of contents to help readers quickly locate the desired sections.
## Suggested Illustrations
1. **Title Concise**: Attract reader attention, describe key points.  

2. **Moderate Information**: Avoid excessive chart information, preferably with annotations.  

3. **Visual Clarity**: Ensure images complement text content, enhancing understanding.
