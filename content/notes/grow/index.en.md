> I have taught myself multiple programming languages, business knowledge, and writing skills. On my bookshelf are hundreds of books I've read in the last two years. I also found time to learn animation design, music composition, and other skills.
> In short, learning has always been easy for me.
> When you read this, you might say, "This person is a genius." "Genius" might be appropriate, but many people are more talented than I am. I just have some good genes, ambitious parents, and a little bit of talent.
> He is ambitious (reflected in his years of maintaining his condition and refining his skills), very smart (reflected in his intelligence on the court and his handling of off-court affairs), and has a strong desire for control.
In the learning process for adults, the biggest obstacle is often not ability, but **self-esteem**. The fear of failure and concern about being judged by others can easily become stumbling blocks to learning.

Learning is a long-term process that requires strategy and methods. Here are some thoughts and suggestions on how to learn efficiently.
## **1. Cognition First**
Ensure you have high-quality sources of information, which is the foundation of efficient learning. Actively collecting quality resources can help you master the latest and most valuable knowledge.
### **High-Quality Information Sources**
-   **Quality Books**: Choose classic books or authoritative works in the field.
-   **Quality Training**: Participate in high-quality courses or lectures to acquire systematic knowledge.
-   **Great Platforms + Great People + Open Mindset**:
    -   Join excellent platforms to connect with top talent in the industry.
    -   Maintain an open mindset to actively absorb new knowledge and perspectives.
## **2. Learning Time Allocation**
Work time is not equivalent to learning time; true learning requires proactive effort. The **Sponge Learning Method** is recommended: set aside at least **1 hour** each day for deep learning, focusing on more complex content.
> **Key Point**: The quality of learning time is more important than the quantity; concentration is the core.
## **3. Learning Methodology**
Mastering the right learning methodology can yield twice the result with half the effort, but it all comes down to the **10,000-Hour Rule** (an average of 3 hours per day for 10 consecutive years). Here are some practical learning methods:
### **Decomposition and Enhancement**
1.  **Decompose Levels -> Decompose Skills -> Decompose Actions**
    Break down complex learning goals into small, executable steps.
2.  **Chain-like Enhancement of Depth**
    -   **Why**: Deepen understanding of the essence of a problem by repeatedly asking "why."
    -   **Domain Layer Diagram/Detail Layer Diagram**: Organize knowledge into layers to form a clear structure.
3.  **Comparative Enhancement of Breadth**
    -   **Which**: Broaden your perspective by comparing different solutions or methods.
    -   **Mind Maps**: Use graphical methods to organize the knowledge system.
4.  **Cyclical Enhancement of Scope**
    Broaden your knowledge base and enhance comprehensive abilities through multi-angle, cross-disciplinary learning.
## **4. Memory and Understanding**
The core of learning lies in organizing, summarizing, and reinforcing information to form a clear structure in the mind, like a library that can be indexed at any time.
### **Understanding Tools**
-   **Pyramid Principle and Mind Maps**: Used to organize thoughts and build logical frameworks.
-   **Timeline Model**: To understand the development patterns of things.
-   **Architecture Diagram**: To understand the overall design of a system.
-   **Flowchart**: To understand business logic.
-   **Class Diagram**: To understand code structure.
### **Strengthening Memory**
-   **Flashcard Tools**: Such as [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/), use spaced repetition to reinforce memory.
-   **Review (复盘)**: Enhance understanding through scenario-based learning.
    -   **Logical Deduction**: Analyze the logic behind cases and think about "why."
    -   **Identify and Fill Gaps**: Discover and fill in gaps in understanding or knowledge.
    -   **Problem-Solving Ability**: Apply knowledge to specific scenarios to deepen understanding.
> **Knowledge Efficiency vs. Engineering Efficiency**
> Knowledge does not directly translate into problem-solving ability; it requires repeated review and practice to deepen understanding. Knowledge becomes concrete and easier to absorb when placed in a specific context.
> **No Result is Also a Result**
> Even if some attempts do not achieve the expected results, you can still learn lessons from them.
## **5. Effectiveness Verification**
The effectiveness of learning needs to be verified through practice. According to the **70-20-10 Rule**, most of a person's experience and abilities come from practice, so it is important to focus on the proportion of practice.
### **Methods of Practice**
-   **Article Sharing**: Output knowledge through writing to test your own understanding.
-   **Meeting Sharing**: Share what you have learned in a team or public setting.
-   **Project Practice**: Apply learned knowledge to actual projects.
-   **Group Discussion**: Deepen understanding through communication with others.
### Learning and Understanding
You understand every word, but you just don't get it, which means you don't understand the principle.
### Willingness to Grow
Make the people around you better.
### Growth Process
-   Deeper levels (talking about value > talking about concepts > talking about implementation).
-   Broader scope.
-   Deeper thinking (books). The right method of work yields twice the result with half the effort.
### Results of Growth
-   Do the project well (in-depth).
-   Do the summary well (depth and breadth).
-   Exert greater influence (increase the scope of influence).
## **Recommended Reading**
-   **《Make It Stick: The Science of Successful Learning》**
    Discusses how to improve learning efficiency through scientific methods, worth reading in depth.

## Holistic Learning
### **1.1 Knowledge Connection and Memory**
-   **Foundation of Holistic Learning**: To achieve memory and application of knowledge by connecting pieces of knowledge.
-   **Core Goal**: To build a good knowledge structure, like drawing an excellent map or designing a well-planned city.
### **1.2 The Importance of Structure**
-   **The Essence of Understanding**: Understanding is the result of a highly developed and complete knowledge structure.
-   **Habit of Smart People**: Every time they learn a new concept, they automatically connect it with other knowledge.
-   **Key to Efficiency Improvement**: Consciously build connections between knowledge, rather than learning passively.
## **2. Techniques and Methods of Holistic Learning**
### **2.1 Models**
-   **Definition of a Model**: A model is a compressed form that condenses multiple key ideas into one place.
    -   It can be a diagram, a metaphor, or an internalized expression.
    -   A model is the core framework of knowledge and the basis for further expansion.
-   **Life Experience as a Source of Models**:
    -   Life experience is the most familiar structure and a major source of models.
    -   Knowledge structures from other disciplines can also be sources of models, as long as they are similar to what is being learned.
#### **Example: Variable Model**
-   In programming, variables can be of different types (like numbers, letters, or words).
-   I imagine them as jars with different openings, which can only hold specific types of data. This metaphor makes a complex concept easy to understand.
### **2.2 Highways**
-   **Cross-Disciplinary Creativity**: Create new knowledge structures by building connections between disciplines that seem unrelated to the average person.
-   **Example: Machiavelli's Views**
    -   Combine Machiavelli's views on governing a state with personal friendships, social status, and management experience to form a unique perspective of understanding.
    -   This "highway" not only deepens the understanding of knowledge but also gives it more practical value.
### **2.3 Perceptual, Relational, and Foundational Mathematical Structures**
-   **Perceptual Structure**: Concrete information based on sensory experience (what is seen, heard, touched).
-   **Relational Structure**: Describes the relationships between things (e.g., cause and effect, comparison, analogy).
-   **Foundational Mathematical Structure**: The logical framework of abstract information (e.g., formulas, theorems, derivations).
## **3. The Sequence of Holistic Learning**
### **3.1 Acquisition Phase**
-   **Simplify**: Focus only on examples that are very helpful for forming a model, ignoring unnecessary details.
-   **Capacity**: Acquire as much information as possible, read more to deepen understanding.
-   **Speed**: Acquire information efficiently (e.g., reading a book in 30 minutes is more efficient than in 1 hour).
#### **Note**
-   If you can't understand a passage, try breaking it down into smaller questions, narrow the scope, and find what you truly don't understand.
### **3.2 Understanding Phase**
-   **Initial Understanding**: Grasp the basic meaning of the information, avoiding rote learning.
-   **In-depth Understanding**: Understand the context of the information, its relationship with other knowledge, and how to apply it to practical problems.
-   **Three Levels**:
    1.  **Understanding Phase**: Initially grasp the meaning of the information.
    2.  **Expansion Phase**: Connect the information with other knowledge.
    3.  **Application Phase**: Use the knowledge to solve real-world problems.
### **3.3 Expansion Phase**
-   **Depth Expansion**: Explore the source of the knowledge, the experimental process, and the logic behind it.
    -   Example: How was a certain formula derived? What is its relationship with other formulas?
-   **Horizontal Expansion**: Look for similar knowledge points and compare their similarities and differences.
    -   Example: What other discoveries are there in the same field? What other related research was conducted during the same period?
-   **Vertical Expansion**: Connect knowledge with patterns from different fields through metaphors and internalization.
    -   Example: Can the wave theory in physics explain group behavior in psychology?
### **3.4 Application Phase**
-   **Practice Makes Perfect**: Apply the learned knowledge to practical problems.
    -   Example: When learning accounting, directly apply the knowledge to manage your own company.
    -   Example: When learning programming, try to write your own programs, or even complete a small project.
## **4. Information Types and Learning Strategies**
### **4.1 Arbitrary Information**
-   **Characteristics**: No patterns, difficult to process, requires rote memorization.
-   **Methods**: Mnemonic techniques, peg system, compression.
### **4.2 Opinion Information**
-   **Characteristics**: Controversial information, often requires diagrams to aid understanding.
-   **Method**: Organize viewpoints with diagrams to analyze their logical relationships.
### **4.3 Process Information**
-   **Characteristics**: Information that teaches how to do something (e.g., swimming, programming).
-   **Method**: Rely on correct models and gradually form a structure through practice.
### **4.4 Concrete Information**
-   **Characteristics**: Information that can be directly observed (e.g., features of plants and animals in biology).
-   **Method**: Deepen memory through sensory experience.
### **4.5 Abstract Information**
-   **Characteristics**: Highly logical but difficult to understand intuitively (e.g., mathematics, physics).
-   **Method**: Use metaphors and internalization to simplify complex knowledge; continuously improve through model error correction.
## **5. Learning Principles and Suggestions**
### **5.1 "Learn It Once" Principle**
-   **Focused Learning**: Concentrate fully on the lecture instead of being busy taking notes.
-   **Efficient Homework**: Completing tasks in one go is more time-saving than doing them in several sessions.
### **5.2 Combining Practice and Interest**
-   **Interest-Driven**: Connect what you are learning with your own interests.
    -   Example: When studying computer science, think about the mysterious symbols of the universe; when studying medicine, imagine real patients; when studying history, feel the vivid stories of historical figures.
-   **Active Application**: Try to use knowledge to solve practical problems during the learning process.
    -   Example: When learning programming, try to write your own programs; when learning accounting, use the knowledge to manage a company.
## **1. The Importance of Creating Connections**
-   **Core Idea**
    -   **The more connections you create, the stronger the memory and the deeper the understanding.**
    -   This is in stark contrast to rote memorization.
## **2. Deep Understanding vs. Rote Memorization**
### **2.1 Bohr's Example**
-   **Bohr's Learning Style**
    -   He didn't just memorize the symbols in a formula; he deeply understood the true meaning of each symbol.
    -   He understood why a particular symbol appeared in a specific place in the formula.
-   **Mastery and Breakthrough of Rules**
    -   Because of his deep understanding of the rules, Bohr could not only use them proficiently but also break them when necessary.
## **3. The Limitations of Rote Memorization**
-   **Characteristics of Rote Memorization**
    -   Just memorizing symbols and formulas without understanding the underlying logic.
    -   The memory is short-lived, easily forgotten, and difficult to apply flexibly.
-   **Advantages of Deep Understanding**
    -   By building connections between pieces of knowledge, you not only remember it better but can also apply it flexibly.
    -   After understanding the essence of the rules, you can creatively solve problems.
