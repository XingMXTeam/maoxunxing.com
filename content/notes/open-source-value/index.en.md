Concepts and Licenses of Open Source and Commercial Software
## **1. Concepts**
### **The Cathedral and the Bazaar**
- **Cathedral**: Commercial software, emphasizing closure and proprietorship.
- **Bazaar**: Open-source software, emphasizing openness and community collaboration.
---
## **2. Classification of Open Source Licenses**
### **Academic-Style Licenses**
- **Characteristics**:
  - When modifying the code, attribution to the original author and a disclaimer are required.
- **Examples**:
  - BSD, Apache, MIT, PHP.
### **Copyleft/Viral Licenses**
- **Characteristics**:
  - Requirements of academic-style licenses + derivative works must also be open source.
- **Examples**:
  - GPL, LGPL, AGPL, CDDL, CPL, EPL, MPL, LGPL.

## **3. Definition of Derivative Works**
### **Derivative Works**
- **Definition**:
  - Modified code (e.g., BlackDuck identifies it as using parts of the code).
  - Compiled works.
  - Static linking (e.g., GPL, AGPL).
### **Non-Derivative Works**
- **Definition**:
  - Runs on a different layer.
  - The open-source program and your own program run independently without interaction.
  - Remote calls (e.g., via API calls).
---
## **4. Definition of Distribution**
- **What constitutes distribution**:
  1. Downloaded to the user's client.
  2. Interaction with the user over a network (not considered distribution, except under AGPL, CPAL, OSL).
  3. Used on the server-side (specifically regulated by AGPL).

## **5. Why Open Source?**
- **Purpose**:
  - To promote technological development through community operation.
  - To attract more developers to participate and improve project quality.
---
## **6. Monetization Models for Open Source Projects**
### **Paid Technical Support**
- Provide professional technical support services for a fee.
### **Paid Commercial Version**
- Offer a more powerful commercial version to meet enterprise needs, charging a license fee.
