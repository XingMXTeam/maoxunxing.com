Frequently Asked Questions:

## 1. Why did you leave your previous job?

- **Core answer**: Mainly for career development.
- **Additional explanation**: Clearly express your goals and demonstrate your plans and expectations for the future.

## 2. How do you handle disputes with others?

- **Core Principle**: Focus on the issue, not the person.
- **Specific Actions**:
  - Treat everyone as equals.
  - Emphasize that the team's goal is to collectively achieve the company's mission.
  - Prioritize problem-solving over personal emotions.

## 3. What if salary negotiations fail?

- **Response Strategy**:  
  - Do not easily offend HR; just listen to what they say.  
  - Stay calm and polite, and avoid direct conflict.  
  - If there are disagreements, try to find a mutually acceptable solution through communication, but do not show excessive hostility.

## 4. How to answer “What are your weaknesses?”

### 1. The essence of the question

- **The key point**:  
  The issue here is not about your specific weaknesses but about assessing your **self-awareness**.  
  - The interviewer wants to understand through your response:
- Whether you possess the ability for **self-criticism**.
    - Whether you can recognize areas where you need to improve.  
  - In the eyes of employers, employees who can acknowledge their weaknesses are more attractive than those who believe they have no weaknesses or are unaware of their shortcomings.

### 2. Core Strategies for Answering

When answering this question, you need to provide a **convincing answer** while avoiding revealing any fatal flaws that could severely impact your job performance.  

- **Key points**:  
  - The flaw mentioned should be a “flaw” that can be viewed as a potential strength.  
  - Not only should you state the flaw, but you should also explain why it is a flaw and demonstrate that you are actively working to improve it.

### Example 1: Overly Focused on Details

**Your Response**:  
> “Sometimes, I become overly focused on a single task, especially when deadlines are tight or the outcome is critical, which may result in reduced attention to other matters.”

**HR Perspective**:  

- You are not adept at multitasking, but this stems from your strong emphasis on results and your commitment to delivering tasks reliably and on time, which is a positive trait.  
- If the role focuses on executing a specific task or process rather than handling multiple tasks simultaneously, this weakness won't be an issue.

### Example 2: Overly Focused on Details

**Your Response**:  
> “I sometimes become too fixated on details and lose sight of the bigger picture.”

**HR Perspective**:  

- Similar to the first weakness, you may become overly focused on one thing and overlook others. 
- However, most employers value detail-oriented employees because they deliver higher-quality work. In contrast, a lack of attention to detail is a bigger issue.

### Example 3: Too Direct

**Your response:**  
> “Sometimes, when pursuing goals, I can be too aggressive or direct, which may lead me to overlook others' feelings.”  

**HR Perspective:**

- This weakness suggests you may have weaker interpersonal skills, but this is because you are highly ambitious and results-oriented.  
- Most employers prefer employees with these traits. In contrast, employees lacking ambition and results-orientation are less appealing.

### 4. Summary of Answering Techniques

- **Don't just state the flaw:**  
  - Explain why it's a flaw, which shows you're aware of your shortcomings.  
  - Indicate you're actively working to improve this flaw, giving HR more confidence in you.

- **Choose weaknesses with high acceptability**:  
  - Certain weaknesses (such as being overly detail-oriented or overly focused) have higher acceptability and can even be seen as potential strengths.  
  - Avoid mentioning weaknesses that could directly impact job performance (such as inability to meet deadlines or lack of teamwork skills).

## Comparison of Job Search Channel Efficiency

- **High-efficiency channels**:  
  - **LinkedIn, Zhaopin, Liepin**: These platforms are suitable for seeking formal positions, with broad coverage and diverse opportunities.  
  - **Internal referrals**: Through referrals from acquaintances or colleagues, the process is typically accelerated and success rates improved.  
  - **Maimai**: Strong social attributes and rapid information dissemination, suitable for quickly obtaining industry trends and opportunities.

- **Slower Channels**:
  - **Boss Zhipin**: While it allows direct communication with employers, the overall process is relatively slow, making it suitable for those patiently seeking precise matches.

## Career Development Recommendations (5 Years Later):

- **Project-Centric Approach**:
  - Accumulating practical project experience is particularly important during the mid-career stage.
  - Participating in high-quality projects can enhance practical skills and add highlights to your resume.

- **Practice Problems and Foundational Reinforcement**:  
  - Continuously practice algorithms and data structures to maintain technical sensitivity.  
  - Solidify computer science fundamentals (such as operating systems, networking, databases, etc.) to prepare for more complex technical challenges.

## **1. The Importance of Practice Problems**

- **The Core Objective of Practice Problems**  
  The goal is not to master every problem, but to become more proficient at solving problems than most people.  
  - **500 Problems Are Key**: Observations show that fewer than 1% of people can complete 500 problems three times or more. Becoming part of that 1% significantly increases your chances of receiving an offer.

- **The Significance of Practice Problems**
- The essence of practice problems is to assess **algorithms and data structures**, with a focus on balancing time complexity and space complexity.  
  - **Applying Knowledge to Similar Problems**: Once you have solved a sufficient number of problems, you will naturally grasp problem-solving strategies and be able to flexibly address similar issues.

- **Recommended Resources**
- **LeetCode**: Practice common questions at least three times to become familiar with high-frequency problems. 
- **GitHub Projects**: Examples include system design compilations and algorithm question compilations (such as [System Design Primer](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer), a classic project with tens of thousands of stars).  

### **2.1 Interview Process**

- **General Hire vs Special Hire**  
  - Most companies follow the “offer first, then group” model (e.g., Facebook, Google).  
  - Companies like Microsoft have hiring managers conduct interviews directly.

- **Language Requirements**  
  - Oral communication skills are not highly emphasized; the key is to explain the problem clearly.  
  - In actual interviews, the first 10 minutes may be in English, but the rest of the time can be in Chinese (most interviewers won't make it hard for fellow Chinese speakers).

- **System Design**  
  - System design is often tested in social recruitment, which is a strong point for Chinese students.  
  - Recommended learning resources: [System Design Primer](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer).

### **3.1 Comparison of job hunting in China and abroad**

- **Advantages of Chinese students**  
  - **Business skills**: Chinese programmers have extensive experience in actual business development.  
  - **Open source frameworks**: Proficiency in mainstream open source frameworks is a major highlight for Chinese programmers.  
  - **Overtime Culture**: Willingness to work overtime and adapt to high-intensity work environments often stands out in foreign companies.

- **Current State of the Overseas Market**  
  - Many overseas professionals who switch fields focus solely on solving problems but lack comprehensive skills. 
  - Domestic students often stand out once they enter foreign companies, making promotions and salary increases relatively easier.  
  - English proficiency requirements are not high; basic practice is sufficient to meet work needs.

### **3.2 Visa and Work Location**

- **Visa Support**  
  - Companies like Facebook will fully assist with visa applications. 
  - If the visa lottery is unsuccessful, one can first work in London, Singapore, or other locations for a year before transferring to the US. 

- **Relocation Allowance**  
  - Companies typically provide several thousand dollars in relocation assistance to help employees transition smoothly.


### **4. Internal Referrals and Information Gathering**

- **Internal Referral Channels**  
  - Internal referrals through LinkedIn or personal connections have a higher success rate.  
  - Internal referrals not only expedite the process but also provide more detailed job information.

- **Understanding the Market**  
  - Use tools like **Glassdoor** and **Blind** to learn about company salaries, interview processes, and internal evaluations.  
  - Keep an eye on the hiring trends of your target companies and prepare in advance.


### **5.1 Success Stories**

- **Toutiao and Alibaba**  
  - Most of my friends who got offers practiced high-frequency questions about three times.  
  - Students from Toutiao and Alibaba are highly capable, with a high probability of securing offers.

- **Facebook Manager Summary**
- Facebook HR noted that Chinese employees are highly capable, but few are willing to put in the effort to practice questions and submit resumes. 
- Some students declined other offers due to having too many stock options.

### **5.2 Designer Pathways**

- For designers, experience can be gained through domestic and international companies, and English communication skills can be improved. 
- There are also successful cases of switching from companies like SAP.
