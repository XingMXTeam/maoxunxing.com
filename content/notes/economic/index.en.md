## **1. What is Macroeconomics**
The macroeconomic model describes the flow of money between housing, government, businesses, financial markets, goods and services markets, labor markets, foreign exchange markets, and the rest of the world.

- **Savings and Investment**:
  - Saving is managing money, while investment is putting money to use.
  - Types of Investment:
    1. **PPE (Property, Plant, and Equipment)**: e.g., factory equipment.
    2. **Inventory**: A high proportion in GDP indicates low efficiency (related to the "de-stocking" part of the "three reductions" policy).
    3. **Self-built housing**: Houses built by individuals or businesses.
- **Services**:
  - e.g., service industries like healthcare and education.

## **2. How to Calculate GDP**
### **2.1 Expenditure Approach**
GDP = C (Consumption) + I (Investment in financial and capital markets) + G (Government spending) + Exports - Imports
### **2.2 Income Approach**
GDP = Labor Income + Capital Income
### **2.3 The Relationship Between Savings and Investment**
S = I (Investment by businesses in domestic financial and capital markets) + Domestic capital outflow - International capital inflow
i.e., S = I + NCO (Net Capital Outflow)
#### **2.3.1 The Role of Financial Markets**
- Financial markets determine the interest rate (rate of return).
- **Relationship between S and r**: The higher the real interest rate, the more savings and the less consumption (positive correlation).
- **Relationship between I and r**: The higher the interest rate, the less willing businesses are to invest (negative correlation).
- **Relationship between NCO and r**:
  - The higher the domestic rate of return, the more negative the correlation between NCO and r.
  - The higher the foreign rate of return, the more positive the correlation between NCO and r.
#### **2.3.2 Relationship between NX and Exchange Rate**
NX = NCO
An increase in the exchange rate leads to a decrease in net exports.
---
## **3. Loanable Funds Market and Foreign Exchange Market**
### **3.1 Loanable Funds Market**
- The interest rate is positively correlated with S and negatively correlated with I + NCO.
- The intersection determines the equilibrium of savings and investment and sets the interest rate r.
### **3.2 Foreign Exchange Market**
- NX is negatively correlated with the exchange rate E.
- Case study of hedge funds attacking the Thai Baht:
  - Borrowing and selling Thai Baht, causing capital flight and a drop in the exchange rate.
---
## **4. Balance of International Payments**
### **4.1 Net Exports and Net Capital Outflow**
- NX (Net Exports) = Exports - Imports
- NCO (Net Capital Outflow) = Capital Outflow - Capital Inflow
- NX = NCO
---
## **5. Why are Foreign Exchange Reserves Increasing?**
NX = NCO = Exports - Imports = Chinese residents + Businesses + Central Bank (ΔForeign Exchange Reserves) - Imports
Central Bank (ΔForeign Exchange Reserves) = NX + Imports - (Chinese residents + Businesses)
- NX and imports are constantly increasing, while export-related investments are subject to financial controls.
---
## **6. What is the Exchange Rate?**
e = $/¥
How many US dollars can 1 RMB be exchanged for, i.e., foreign currency / domestic currency.
---
## **7. What is Purchasing Power Parity?**
### **7.1 Purchasing Power Parity Formula**
The cost of two baskets of consumer goods:
- Production cost in China, P_China (priced in RMB)
- Production cost in the US, P_US (priced in USD)
If 100/P_China > 100e/P_US, then buy goods from China and sell them in the US.
Eventually, the arbitrage opportunity disappears. The exchange rate adjusts the fastest, and prices may also change.
e = P_US / P_China
This is purchasing power parity.
---
## **8. What is Financial Arbitrage?**
### **8.1 Interest Rate Arbitrage**
Assume r_China (China's interest rate) > r_US (US interest rate), then borrow USD to invest in China.
Current exchange rate e0, next period exchange rate e1.
Investment return formula:
- Return on investment in China: e1 × (100/e0 × (1 + r_China))
- Return on investment in the US: 100 × (1 + r_US)
If e1 × (100/e0 × (1 + r_China)) - 100 × (1 + r_US) > 0, the arbitrage is successful.
---
## **9. What is the Real Interest Rate?**
Real Interest Rate = Nominal Interest Rate - Inflation Expectation
E = e × CPI_domestic / CPI_foreign
e = (Foreign currency 1/6.5) / (Domestic currency 1)
- The nominal exchange rate reflects current purchasing power, but the CPI (Consumer Price Index) must be considered.
---
## **10. Why Don't Export-Oriented Enterprises Invest Abroad?**
- Revenue (USD) - Costs (RMB)
- Real Exchange Rate E = e × CPI_domestic / CPI_foreign
  - e increases (appreciation against foreign currency), CPI_domestic increases (depreciation domestically), the real exchange rate rises.
  - With USD pricing unchanged, revenue decreases, costs increase, and gross margin falls.
---
## **11. The Power of Compounding**
- At a 10% annual growth rate, it doubles in 7 years.
- At a 7% annual growth rate, it doubles in 10 years.
---
## **12. What is Financial Repression?**
- Nothing can fully hedge against inflation.
---
## **13. Relationship between Exchange Rates and Interest Rates**
The interest rate can be seen as the rate of return for investing in a country.
When the Fed raises interest rates, r_US > r_China, capital flows to the US, and the USD appreciates.
---
## **14. What is Goods Arbitrage?**
Assume the price of a certain commodity is P_China in China and P_US in the US.
With 100 RMB:
- You can buy 100/P_China in China
- You can buy 100e/P_US in the US
If 100/P_China > 100e/P_US, then buy the commodity in China and sell it in the US to earn the price difference.

## **15. What is Friedman's Theory?**
Rational income allocation: Spend future middle-age income when young, and spend middle-age savings after retirement.
---
## **16. Why are Banks so Profitable?**
- Banks make profits through the net interest margin (about 2.5%).
- Shadow banks (like WeBank) lend without reserve requirements; enterprises borrow from shadow banks to invest.
- Bank intermediaries recommend wealth management products, earning a spread, while users earn investment returns.
---
## **17. What is M2?**
M2: Money Supply
Δm = ΔMB × MM
- Δm: Total money supply increase
- ΔMB: Money issued by the central bank (Monetary Base)
- MM: Money Multiplier
---
## **18. The Role of Issuing Currency**
- To avoid monetary deflation, print money.
- Measures for the central bank to withdraw funds and reduce inflation:
  1. Borrowing (e.g., issuing government bonds).
  2. Increasing the reserve requirement ratio.
---
## **19. What are Surplus and Deficit?**
- **Surplus**: Exports > Imports.
- **Deficit**: Imports > Exports.
---
## Market Economy
- **There's no such thing as a free lunch**
  This is the cornerstone of a market economy, revealing a fundamental truth:
  - **Everything has a cost**.
    Whether explicit or implicit, acquiring and using resources requires a price to be paid.
### **Interpretation**
1. **Resource Scarcity**
   - In a market economy, resources are scarce, and every choice comes with an opportunity cost.
   - Acquiring one resource means giving up other possibilities.
2. **The Relationship Between Value and Cost**
   - Behind every product, service, or decision, there are hidden costs of production, time, energy, etc.
   - Things that are "free" often have indirect costs, such as through advertising or data collection.
3. **Implications for Individuals and Society**
   - For individuals: Make rational decisions, weigh the pros and cons, and avoid the lure of "free".
   - For society: Understand market principles and respect the value of labor and resources.
