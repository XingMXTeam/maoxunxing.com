## Sources of Return

### Key Points

- **Corporate Profits**: Directly derived from corporate operating income.
- **Company Valuation**: Valuation increases are an important source of excess returns, especially valuation expansion driven by falling US interest rates.
- **Risk-Free Rate vs. Company Valuation**: Company valuations are not benchmarked against the risk-free rate, but rather against the overall performance of US companies.

### Sources of Excess Returns

- Excess returns primarily stem from valuation increases driven by falling US interest rates, rather than corporate profit growth.

## Interest Rates and Leverage Strategies

### Short-Term Interest Rates vs. Long-Term Interest Rates

- **Short-term interest rates** are always lower than **long-term interest rates** (long-term returns).
- **Strategies**:
- **Borrow short, buy long**: Use short-term low-interest financing to invest in long-term high-return assets.
  - **Timing for leveraging**: During an economic recession (when interest rates are too high and need to be cut), borrow more funds to increase leverage.

### Financial Returns vs. Labor Income

- Financial returns far exceed labor income and corporate operating income.
- **Gold and Bitcoin**: When interest rates are extremely low, capital flows into liquid assets such as gold or Bitcoin. Gold prices can be viewed as the inverse of capital costs.

## Economic Cycles and Asset Allocation

### The US Economy Over the Past 40 Years

- **Deflation at the Bottom, Inflation at the Top**: Over the past 40 years, the bottom tier of the US population has faced deflationary pressures, while the wealth of the top tier has continued to expand.
- **Current Reversal**: The situation is now reversed, and it is important to focus on cash flow businesses rather than leveraged businesses.

### The Smartest Traders

- **Bond Market**: The smartest traders are often active in the bond market (interest rate market).
- **Cross-Asset Trading**: Different markets react differently to expectations, making cross-asset trading particularly important. For example, when the market is shouting “southbound” (Hong Kong), it may be a retreat signal.

## Balance Sheet Recession

### Definition

- **Balance sheet recession** is an economic recession caused by high private sector debt, leading individuals or businesses to repay debt and increase savings rather than consume or invest, thereby slowing or reducing economic growth.
- **Proposer**: Economist Gu Zhaoming.
- **Related Concepts**: Related to Irving Fisher's description of “debt deflation.”

### Examples

- **Japan's economic recession** (beginning in 1990).
- **The Great Recession in the United States** (2007-2009).

### Current Phenomena

- Businesses are reluctant to invest.
- Residents are reluctant to consume or borrow to consume.
- The financial system is eager to lend, but the central bank's monetary easing has limited effect.

## Bond Market Investment

### Investment Methods

1. **Bank APP/Counter**:
   - **Book-entry government bonds**: These are usually snapped up.
   - **Local government bonds** and **China Development Bank bonds**: These are interest-bearing bonds.
   - **Taxation Notes**: Except for government bonds, interest income from other bonds is subject to a 20% income tax.

2. **Exchange Securities Accounts**:
   - Can invest in various types of bonds.

3. **Bond Funds**:
   - Include interest-bearing bonds, credit bonds, convertible bonds, corporate bonds, etc.
   - High-yield products (such as subordinated bonds, corporate short-term financing bills, and foreign currency bonds) are generally not directly investable by individual investors.

### Important Notes

- **Expected Returns**: Consider whether the yield aligns with your investment objectives.
- **Liquidity**: Ensure funds can be flexibly allocated.
- **Risk Tolerance**: Select appropriate investment products based on your risk tolerance.

## Decisions on Early Mortgage Repayment

### Decision-Making Criteria

- **Interest Rate Differential**: If you have spare cash, early mortgage repayment allows you to earn the interest rate differential.
- **Opportunity Cost**: If the return on other investments is higher than the mortgage interest rate, early repayment is not recommended.

## Interpretation of Macroeconomic Data

### Key Indicators

1. **Investment**:  
   - Fixed asset investment (infrastructure, real estate, etc.) has declined.
2. **Consumption Growth**:  
   - Negative data indicates weak consumption.
3. **Imports and Exports**:  
   - Exports have declined significantly.
4. **Employment**:  
   - Focus on structural issues rather than averages:
     - Youth employment (whether attending university offers prospects).
     - Migrant worker employment/re-employment.

### Gap Between Chinese and U.S. High-Tech Companies

- The gap is widening.
- Regional economic disparities within China are also growing.

### Business Environment

- The PMI (Purchasing Managers' Index) reflects business activity.
- **Declining return on capital**: Loans, as liabilities, are failing to generate sufficient output returns.
- **Monetary easing vs. credit tightening**: Monetary easing is evident from M2, but credit tightening is also evident.

## Monetary Policy and Fiscal Policy

### Monetary Policy

- **Emerging market countries**: Countries lacking foreign exchange reserves need to curb currency depreciation and are often forced to follow suit with interest rate hikes, but this places a heavy burden on the economy.
- **China**: Needs to lower interest rates to stimulate business activity.

### Fiscal Policy

- **Bond Issuance**: Securing funds through the issuance of local government bonds.
- **Whether the People's Bank of China Buys Bonds**: The key lies in whether it provides monetary supply.

## Comparison of the Chinese and US Economies

### Considerations for US Interest Rate Hikes

- The Federal Reserve's decisions to raise or lower interest rates are based on multiple factors, including inflation and employment.

### Northbound Capital

- Northbound capital is aggressively purchasing Chinese assets, which may indicate foreign investors' confidence in the Chinese market.

## Investment Recommendations and Risk Preferences

### Current Market Outlook

- **United States**: Interest rates may not be lowered this year, and returns may decline.
- **China**:
  - Fiscal and monetary policies are being implemented.
  - The real estate sector is being revived, but economic recovery is constrained by balance sheet recession.
  - The stock market is likely to fluctuate around the 3,200-point level, with the worst-case scenario being a drop below 3,000 points.

### Investment Directions

- **Cash Flow Businesses**: Prioritize assets with stable cash flow.
- **Youth Market**: Emerging asset classes such as sports cards and NFTs are worth watching.
- **Gold and Bitcoin**: Can serve as liquidity vehicles in an environment of extremely low interest rates.
