## **1. Cultivating Children's Interests: The Example of Reading**
- **Case Study**  
  > "I started reading the original English version of 'Harry Potter' in the fifth grade. At first, I had my mom summarize and explain it to me, one chapter at a time. This made me look forward to the content of the book, so I started reading independently."  
  > Accompanying a child through 6 years of elementary school requires a focus on companionship and education. Love is demonstrated through actions, not just emotions. True love is not a feeling, but a responsibility and a commitment.
- **Method Summary**  
  - **Sparking Interest**: Guide the child through summarizing and explaining to arouse curiosity about the content.  
  - **Gradual Transition**: Move from parent-child reading to independent reading to develop the child's independent learning skills.  
  - **Choosing Appropriate Content**: Select books that are interesting to the child and of moderate difficulty to avoid frustration.

## **2. Children's Education: Planning for High School and College Entrance Exams**
### **2.1 The Importance of the High School Entrance Exam (Zhongkao)**
- **The First Hurdle: The Critical Nature of the High School Entrance Exam**  
  - The high school entrance exam is a crucial turning point that determines future educational paths, directly impacting college entrance exams and university choices.  
  - **Goal Setting**:  
    - If a child cannot get into a key municipal middle school with a 60%+ acceptance rate to top-tier universities, even if they are first in their grade, they can essentially forget about top universities like Tsinghua, Peking, Fudan, and Jiao Tong.  
    - If they can't get into a key municipal middle school, they can basically forget about 985 universities.  
- **Target Schools for Different Levels**  
  - **Mid-level in the grade**: To have a stable chance at a 985 university, only students from the "Big Four" famous schools have a real opportunity.  
  - **Mid-level in the "Eight King Kongs"**: Usually can only aim for 211 universities.  
- **Regional Advantages**  
  - Yangpu and Xuhui districts have significant advantages in the high school entrance exam competition, making them suitable for top students aiming for prestigious schools.
