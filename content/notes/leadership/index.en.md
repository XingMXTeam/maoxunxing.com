Technical insights refer to the application of technology or design through innovative methods to achieve one or both of the following objectives:

- Significantly reduce production costs.  
- Significantly enhance product functionality and usability.

## The Value of Technical Insights

1. **Create a competitive edge**  
   Products produced using technical insights can differentiate themselves from similar competitive products and stand out in the market.

2. **Enhance product appeal**  
   This innovation not only significantly improves product quality or functionality but also allows consumers to intuitively perceive its **unique value** without relying on large-scale marketing.

3. **Naturally Winning the Market**  
   Products with genuine technical insights can attract consumers through their own advantages, reducing reliance on marketing and achieving **word-of-mouth promotion** and **user recognition**.


## No Silver Bullet

The so-called “no silver bullet” refers to the fact that no single technology or method can increase software engineering productivity tenfold within a decade.

## Proposals Without Attribution


> Our colleague Xiao Na Brown describes this as a “propose without attribution” approach. This sounds simple, but it is not. The “hippos” hold sway over the company, while brave creative elites risk being trampled by the hippos to defend quality and performance. Only when hippos and creative elites participate equally can an environment of meritocracy be created.

> — This phrase sounds simple, but it is far from it.



1. **The metaphor of the “hippo”**  
   - The “hippo” refers to senior managers in the company who have the highest power or the greatest influence (HiPPO: Highest Paid Person's Opinion).  
   - In many traditional companies, the opinions of the “hippo” are often decisive, dominating the direction of decision-making, while ignoring the voices of others.

2. **The Challenge for Creative Elites**  
   - Creative elites are employees who are creative and willing to challenge the status quo.  
   - In a Hippo-dominated environment, creative elites may face the risk of being suppressed or even “crushed,” as they must defend quality and performance while challenging authority.

3. **The Importance of Equal Participation**  
   - Only when “elephants” and creative elites participate equally in discussions can a truly meritocratic environment be created.  
   - In such an environment, the best ideas prevail, rather than the opinions of those in power dominating the discussion.


## The Key to Achieving “Proposals Without Bias”

### 1. Encourage an Open Culture

- Establish an open, inclusive corporate culture where everyone feels their voice is valued.  
- Example:  
  - Hold regular brainstorming sessions with clear rules—all proposals are considered regardless of position.  
  - Set up an anonymous proposal channel to avoid bias due to identity differences.

### 2. Emphasize Data-Driven Decision-Making

- Evaluate the value of proposals using data and facts, rather than relying on personal authority or subjective judgment.  
- Example:  
  - If a proposal involves product improvements, validate its effectiveness using user testing data.  

### 3. Empower creative elites with greater influence

- Ensure that creative elites play an important role in the decision-making process, rather than merely executing decisions passively.  
- Example:  
  - Establish a “creative director” position within the project team, granting them the authority to make final decisions on the proposal.

### 4. Self-restraint among senior leadership

- Senior managers must be aware of their influence and actively avoid using their opinions to suppress others.  
- Example:  
  - Delay expressing opinions during discussions and listen to team members' ideas first.

## **1. Key experiences when sharing**

### **1.1 Explain new terminology or tools when they appear**

- When sharing, if new technical terminology or tools are involved, be sure to explain them clearly.
- Ensure that the audience understands the meaning of these terms and their application scenarios.

### **1.2 Avoid frequent interface switching during presentations**

- Minimize interface switching during presentations to avoid frequent jumps.
- Frequent interface switching can make it difficult for the audience to keep up with the pace, affecting the overall experience.

### **1.3 Have a clear main thread**

- The content you share should be organized around a clear main thread.
- A main thread can help the audience better understand the core content of your presentation and avoid information overload.

### **1.4 Avoid sharing too much content**

- Control the amount of content you share to avoid overwhelming the audience with too much information at once.
- Highlight key points to ensure the audience can absorb and understand the core content.
