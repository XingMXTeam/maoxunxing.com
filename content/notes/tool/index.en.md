## Apple ID for US region
This article is based on the key steps from [Zhihu article](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/367821925), organizing a detailed process on how to set up a US Apple ID on an iPhone and complete payment methods.

### 1. Change Device Language and Region


1. Open **iPhone Settings**.


2. Go to **General > Language & Region**.
---
- Change the device language and region to **English (US)** (United States).
3. Switch the account for media and purchase items:
   - Click **Apple Menu > System Settings**.
   - Find and click **[Your Name]** at the top of the sidebar (if you don't see your name, tap "Sign in with your Apple ID").
- Log in with your newly registered **US Apple ID**.
---


### 2. Change Apple ID Language and Region
1. Open the [Apple ID management page](https://appleid.apple.com/account/manage/section/information).
2. Log in with your newly registered **US Apple ID**.
3. In **Personal Information**:
   - Change **Language** and **Region** to **English (United States)** (United States).

### 3. Configure Payment Method
1. Open **App Store**, and log in with your newly registered **U.S. Apple ID**.
2. Download any paid software (such as in-app purchases for free trials).
3. When the system prompts to select a payment method:
   - The page will display **Credit Card** or **PayPal**, ignore these options.
   - Directly fill in other necessary information (such as billing address, etc.), refer to the following tutorial for details:
- **Billing Address**: You can use a virtual address generator (such as [FakerAddress](https://www.fakeraddress.com/)) to generate a U.S. address.
     - **Phone Number**: Ensure you enter the same number as used during Apple ID registration.
