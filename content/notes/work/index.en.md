First, when I work, I don't distinguish between what I should do and what I shouldn't. After finishing my own work, for most colleagues' questions, as long as I can help solve them, I do it. At that time, I had reviewed most of the code in the Code Base. When new employees joined, as long as I had time, I would explain everything to them. Through explaining, I also grew myself.

Another characteristic is that in the first two years of working, I basically came home every day at 12 or 1 a.m. and continued programming until quite late. It was indeed because of interest, not because the company required it. So I quickly moved from being responsible for a module that extracted crawlers to being responsible for the entire backend system, starting to lead a team, then a small department, and later a large department.

Additionally, there's one more point: not setting boundaries when doing things. Back then, I was responsible for technology, but when there were issues with the product, I would actively participate in discussions and come up with product solutions. Many people said this wasn't my job. But I want to say: your sense of responsibility, your motivation to do things well, will drive you to do more and give you great training.

I was an engineer at the time, but my experience with products greatly helped me later when I transitioned into product management. My involvement in business aspects also greatly benefited my current work. I remember at the end of 2007, I went with the company's sales director to meet clients. This experience taught me what good sales really are. When I was building Toutiao and hiring people, these reference cases helped me avoid being completely clueless in this field.
