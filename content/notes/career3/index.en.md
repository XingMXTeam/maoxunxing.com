## Launch
- **The minimum MVP must be useful**: Don't just put an email sign-up box. After finishing the feature, check it yourself multiple times, and have more people check it as well.
- **The value of a subscription**: When asking others to subscribe, tell them what you are offering. You should provide something useful, not frequent notifications. For example, add web notification capabilities to your site.
> **Additional Notes**:
>
> - The core of an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) is to solve a real user problem, not to pursue feature completeness.
> - Provide a clear value proposition that makes users willing to actively participate and use it.

## Traction
### Core Concepts
- **Product Risk**: People want your stuff (Lean).
- **Market Risk**: You can reach customers sustainably (Traction).
- **Traction Goal**:
  - How many customers do you need to be profitable or raise funding?
  - How many customers do you need? What is the growth rate?
  - The traction strategy always revolves around the traction goal, achieving it step by step.
> **Critical Path**:
>
> - Entrepreneurs eventually become experts in a particular channel, focusing on the core channel that brings the most value.
> - For example, by inviting friends to try a service, they can get incentives like 3 months of free usage or an e-book from a blog.

## Case Studies
### The Growth of DuckDuckGo
- **Initial Attempts**:
  - Used SEO and viral marketing as primary traction channels.
  - Built a widget that displayed users' social media profile links and follower counts, but it had limited effect.
- **Successful Pivot**:
  - Shifted to content marketing, social ads, and business development, gradually expanding the user base.
  - Ultimately achieved rapid growth through a combination of multiple channels.
> **Summary**:
>
> - Traction trumps everything. If you charge for your product, it means customers are buying; if your product is free, your user base should be growing.
> - Find your bright spot customers, analyze their needs in-depth, and expand on these successful patterns.
