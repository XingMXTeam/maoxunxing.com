- **Case studies combined with practicality**: By illustrating the applicability of analytical methods through the characteristics of specific industries (such as hydropower generation, real estate), it enhances practicality.
---
- **Multi-dimensional perspective**: Analyzing corporate financial statements from three dimensions—structure, history, and peers—to comprehensively reveal the operational status and competitiveness of the enterprise.
## What I Liked

- **Some content is complex**: For beginners, certain analytical methods (such as preparing cash flow statements using the indirect method) may require repeated reading to fully understand.

- **Lack of interactive exercises**: Although the content is detailed, it lacks practical cases or tool recommendations, which may require readers to supplement hands-on experience on their own.

- **Unusual situations not elaborated**: Mentioning the identification of unusual situations in the three financial statements but not elaborating on them in detail is a bit of a 遗憾.
1. **Analysis of the Balance Sheet**:
- First look at assets = liabilities + equity to clarify the sources of assets; then examine the proportion of owner's equity to determine the capital structure.

   - **Light Asset vs Heavy Asset**: Companies with a low proportion of production materials in total assets and a significantly higher pre-tax profit/production materials ratio than the social average return rate are considered light asset companies.

   - **Return on Equity (ROE)**: Warren Buffett's core metric for measuring the performance of a business.
## What I Disliked
   - **Historical and Peer Comparison**: Focus on the trend of changes in a company's assets and the dynamics of its competitors.
- **Financial Health Indicators**: Interest-bearing debt ratio, Cash and equivalents/Interest-bearing debt ≥1, Accounts receivable ratio does not exceed more than half of total assets.
2. **Income Statement Analysis**:
   - **Revenue Growth**: Only by exceeding the industry average can market share expansion be proven.

   - **Gross Profit Margin**: Above 40% usually indicates sustainable competitive advantages, while below 20% warrants cautious attention.
---
- **Cost Ratio**: (Selling Expenses + Administrative Expenses + Financial Expenses) / Operating Revenue, be wary of companies with excessively high cost ratios.
## Key Takeaways
   - **Operating Profit Margin**: Operating Profit / Operating Revenue, analyze the reasons for price increases, cost reductions, or expense control, as well as their sustainability.

3. **Cash Flow Statement Analysis**:
   - **Key Indicator**: Operating Cash Flow Net / Net Profit consistently greater than 1 indicates that goods or services are in short supply.
- **Preparation Method**:
     1. Add back non-expensed costs (such as depreciation, asset impairment).
     2. Subtract non-operating income (such as investment income, interest income).
     3. Subtract cash outflows not included in costs (such as deferred taxes, inventory, accounts receivable and payable).
- **VAT Verification**: The cash received from selling goods should be 1.17 times the operating revenue (including VAT), theoretically greater than 1 is considered good.
   - **Corporate Portrait**: Determine the type of business (fairy type, hen type, bull type, cow type) through multiple years of financial reports.

4. **Comprehensive Analysis Method**:
   - **Continuously Monitor High-Quality Companies**: Track the financial reports of high-quality enterprises over the long term to identify investment opportunities.
- **Exceptional Case Identification**: Further research is needed on the exceptional data in the three tables, and judgment should be made in combination with industry characteristics.

5. **Precautions**:
   - **Industry Characteristics**: Certain industries (such as hydropower generation, real estate) are not suitable for general analytical methods and require adjustments based on industry-specific features.
   - **Avoid Optimism Bias**: Maintain a rational attitude towards revenue growth and be wary of overly optimistic expectations.
- **Impact of cost control**: Whether cost control harms a company's long-term competitiveness needs to be carefully evaluated.
