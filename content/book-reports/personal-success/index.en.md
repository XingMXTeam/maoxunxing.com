## What I Liked
- **Clear Core Philosophy**: The book clearly states that asset allocation is the core of investment, advising against market timing and security selection, and reducing the frequency of trades.
- **High Practicality**: It provides specific asset allocation ratio recommendations (e.g., 30% domestic stocks, 20% real estate), offering practical guidance for investors.
- **International Perspective**: It covers not only the U.S. market but also investment tools in global markets (like the Nasdaq index, Nikkei 225 ETF), broadening the investment horizon.
- **Combination of Theory and Practice**: By analyzing the characteristics of different asset classes (such as bonds, stocks, real estate), it helps readers understand how to build a diversified investment portfolio.

## What I Disliked
- **Some Content Not Fully Applicable to Chinese Investors**: The asset allocation ratios and tools recommended in the book are primarily based on the U.S. market, which has certain limitations for the practical operations of Chinese investors.
- **Lack of In-depth Case Studies**: Although some specific investment tools are mentioned, it does not provide detailed case studies or practical implementation steps.
- **Limited Discussion on Non-Core Assets**: Emerging asset classes like cryptocurrencies and options are only briefly mentioned, without in-depth exploration of their risks and opportunities.

## Key Takeaways
1. **Definition of Core Assets**:
   - Core assets are asset classes that can provide stable returns over the long term, including domestic stocks, foreign developed market stocks, emerging market stocks, real estate, government bonds, and inflation-protected bonds.
   - The recommended asset allocation is:
     - Domestic Stocks: 30%
     - Foreign Developed Market Stocks: 15%
     - Emerging Market Stocks: 5%
     - Real Estate: 20%
     - U.S. Treasury Bonds: 15%
     - Inflation-Protected Bonds: 15%
2. **The Importance of Asset Allocation**:
   - Asset allocation is the primary source of investment returns; it requires maintaining a reasonable balance and diversification.
   - Avoid active market timing and security selection, as buying high and selling low is a common mistake. One should adhere to buying low and selling high to maintain constant asset allocation ratios.
3. **Principles of Stock Investment**:
   - Security selection is not recommended for average investors because it is often a negative-sum game, with returns falling below the market average after deducting fees.
   - One can choose broad-based index funds (like CSI 300 ETF, S&P 500 VOO) or stocks of high-quality companies (such as Microsoft, Tesla, Moutai, Tencent).
4. **Key Points of Bond Investment**:
   - When interest rates rise, bond prices fall; when interest rates fall, bond prices rise.
   - Chinese investors can purchase government bonds or bond products available on major banking apps.
5. **Real Estate Investment**:
   - Renting out commercial real estate can generate a steady stream of cash flow, but it requires the individual's ability to identify good locations.
6. **Inflation-Protected Bonds**:
   - There is no direct equivalent product in the domestic market. One can consider U.S. Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) related ETFs (with a 0.04% fee) or gold-related investments (physical gold, gold mining stocks, gold ETFs).
7. **Diversified Investment Strategy**:
   - Diversification is key to reducing risk; avoid over-concentration in any single asset class.
   - An equity-oriented portfolio typically yields higher returns than bonds and cash, but one must be mindful of the risk of a stock market crash.
8. **Risks of Non-Core Assets**:
   - Cryptocurrencies (like Bitcoin, Ethereum), arms dealer stocks (like LMT), and technology sector ETFs (like XLK) are not considered core assets and carry significant risk.
   - Areas like insurance and options trading are complex and require cautious participation.
9. **Core Asset Choices for Chinese Investors**:
   - Domestic Stocks: CSI 300 ETF, stocks of high-quality companies (like Moutai, Tencent).
   - Foreign Markets: Nasdaq Index (QQQ), S&P 500 (VOO), Nikkei 225 ETF, etc.
   - Real Estate: Renting out commercial properties.
   - Gold: Physical gold, gold ETFs, or gold mining stocks.
10. **The Path to Successful Personal Investing**:
    - Implement a diversified, passively managed, equity-oriented investment portfolio.
    - Abandon actively managed funds and choose passively managed index funds with low taxes and low management fees.
    - Adhere to long-term investing and avoid frequent trading.
