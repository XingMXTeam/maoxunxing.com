## What I Liked

- **Some Content is More Specialized**: For readers without a financial background, certain terms (such as "accrual basis") may require additional study to fully understand.

- **Lack of interactivity**: As a book that leans towards theory, it lacks practical exercises or tool recommendations, which may require readers to supplement hands-on experience on their own.

1. **Accounting Entries and the Three Major Financial Statements**:
   - A debit increases assets, a credit increases liabilities; accounting entries record a company's financial flows, ultimately forming the income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow statement.

   - The income statement reflects operating results, the balance sheet reflects financial position, and the cash flow statement reflects changes in cash flow.

2. **Core of the Income Statement**:

---
   - Accrual accounting may lead to profit manipulation, attention should be paid to gross profit margin, net profit margin, and non-operating income.
## What I Disliked

   - Profit does not equal cash flow, it is necessary to analyze the proportion of costs, taxes, and expenses by combining notes.
3. **Importance of the Balance Sheet**:
- Assets are arranged by liquidity, and liabilities are listed by urgency.

   - Focus on items such as accounts receivable, inventory, accounts payable, etc., to analyze the company's competitiveness and industry position.

4. **Role of the Cash Flow Statement**:

## Key Takeaways
   - The net operating cash flow/core profit should be between 1.2 and 1.5 for a healthy balance.
- Cash flow cannot directly measure profit, but it can reflect a company's liquidity.

5. **The Interconnection of the Three Financial Statements**:
   - Sales revenue drives accounts receivable, while operating costs affect inventory and accounts payable.
   - Net profit minus dividends equals retained earnings, but retained earnings are not a cash reserve.

6. **Business Operating Objectives**:
   - Earn profits, control assets and liabilities, and secure cash flow.
   - Calculate operating leverage: Companies with high fixed costs need to increase sales to reduce risk.

7. **Evaluating Business Competitiveness**:
- Gross profit margin, profit margin, supplier payment arrangement ability, and repayment arrangement ability are key indicators.
   - An increase in accounts receivable or cash inflow lower than operating revenue may indicate weak repayment ability.

8. **Corporate Expansion Strategy**:
   - Determine the company's stage (expansion, maturity, or transformation) by analyzing changes in operating assets, investment assets, and financing activities.

9. **Business Model Analysis**:
   - Inventory turnover rate and gross profit margin can determine whether a company competes through differentiation or scale.

10. **Identifying Operational and Financial Risks**:
    - The "three-high" problem (high financial expenses, high short-term liabilities, high in a specific asset) needs to be 警惕.
- Current ratio ≥ 2, quick ratio ≥ 1, are healthy solvency indicators.

11. **Indicators of Deteriorating Profit Quality**:
    - A decrease in administrative expenses, changes in accounting policies, an increase in accounts receivable, and a slower inventory turnover rate could all be warning signs.

12. **Goodwill and Fair Value**:
- Goodwill is based on fair value, and attention should be paid to its reasonableness and potential impairment risk.

13. **Three Stages of Entrepreneurship**:
    - Conception (technology, users, model), Execution (product, service), Validation (performance and financial data).

14. **Common Ratios**:
- The price-to-earnings ratio is the inverse of the return on investment, and ROE > 15% can be used as a criterion for selecting high-quality companies.

15. **Identifying Financial Reporting Traps**:
    - Compare with peer companies and historical data, paying attention to abnormal situations such as average salary, cash-to-short-term-debt ratio, etc.

16. **The Importance of Footnotes**:
- Footnotes in financial statements conceal important information; it is necessary to carefully read the board report and disclosures of major matters.

17. **Three ways to make money**:
    - Physical arbitrage, advertising monetization, financial arbitrage (information asymmetry).

18. **Customer value**:
- The lowest total cost (time, money, emotion), optimal quality, and optimal service are key to enhancing customer value.
