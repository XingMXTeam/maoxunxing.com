## What I Liked

- **Geographical limitations**: Some content related to company registration and payments is more biased towards the Western market, with limited applicability in China.
### Idea Validation

- **Start from the problem**: Collect your own ideas, prioritize solving the problems you encounter, and ensure the ideas are small enough and executable.

- **Sorting and filtering**: Sort and filter ideas based on interest and feasibility, choosing the direction you most want to pursue.
- **Cultivating originality**: If you don’t have ideas, you can spark creativity by experiencing new things; sharing ideas isn’t afraid of being plagiarized, the key lies in action.

- **Web-First Strategy**: Prioritize web application development, which is cost-effective and easy to iterate, with web and native gradually converging in the future.
- **Advantages without investment**: Lack of external funding can actually be an advantage, as you have 100% control over the product.
#### Recommended tools:

- **Start with a small niche market**: First promote to friends or specific groups, then gradually expand the user base.
- **Quick validation**: Continuously optimize through feedback, and directly submit to online platforms to gain exposure.
- **Abandon products that don't motivate you**: If a product cannot keep you consistently invested, then abandon it decisively.
#### Feedback channels:

- **Media Exposure**: Send concise emails to journalists to secure coverage.  
  Sample Email:  
  Subject: Food delivery startup for pets  
  Hi Jody! I made a site that lets you subscribe to food delivery for your pet. Let me know if you need more info :)

- **Product Launch Platforms**: Product Hunt, Hacker News, Reddit, Indie Hackers, BetaList, etc.  
  
- **Social Media**: Utilize platforms like Snapchat, Instagram, Twitter, Xiaohongshu to express yourself.  
### Growth

---
- **Open Construction**: Engage users through storytelling, allowing them to easily share products (such as readable URLs).

- **User Co-creation**: Involve users in product development, building APIs or finding competitive advantages.

- **Continuous Updates**: Regularly release new features or content to maintain user engagement.
### Monetization
- **Early Revenue Validation**: Don't be afraid to charge money; consider the profit model during construction.
- **Subscriptions are better than one-time payments**: Subscription models suit community-based products, such as forums, chat groups, social networks, etc.

- **Lifetime option**: Calculate one-time payment amounts based on customer lifetime value (LTV) to meet different user needs.

- **Pay for connection**: Users are more willing to pay for connection than content; community models are the ideal choice.
