### What is the role of money?

1. **Changing lives**  

   Poverty is more likely to lead to misfortune, while money can bring respect, freedom, and the ability to help others. It is not the only source of happiness, but it is a neutral tool.

2. **Achieving dreams
## What I Disliked

If your dream is to make friends or live a more interesting life, money can provide you with more choices and opportunities.
3. **Self-improvement**  

The key to a happy life lies in changing yourself, not simply relying on money. Money is just a means to achieve goals.
### II. Investment What problems does it solve?

## Key Takeaways 

1. **Document Success Stories**  

   Investing is not just about recording past successes, but also about deeply reflecting on future possibilities. By reviewing successful cases, boost confidence and find the right direction for yourself.
2. **Clarify Direction**  

   Without investing, people often fail to think about how to make money in their areas of expertise, instead wasting energy on things they don't like.
3. **Conquer Fear**  

   Confidence is more important than intelligence. By reviewing investments and drawing strength from past successes, believe in your ability to accomplish anything.
4. **Daily Practice**  

   Write down at least 5 future-oriented thoughts every day to continuously motivate yourself forward.
### What is the function of a dream album?

1. **Establishing Desire**  

   Imagine already possessing the things in your dreams, transforming small wishes into strong desires, thereby overcoming difficulties.

2. **Strengthening Belief
---

- Persevering with the plan during the most challenging times leads to outstanding performance.  
   - Do the right thing, even if someone laughs at you, more people will recognize you.  
3. **Action speaks louder than words**  

   After truly putting in the effort, excuses are unnecessary. Luck is the result of thorough preparation and hard work. Focus on solving the problem, not on finding excuses.
4. **Breaking Through Limits**  

   Crazy goals are easier to achieve than ordinary goals because they require more effort and focus.
### Four, How to Build Passive Income?

1. **Solve Difficult Problems**

Solving a difficult problem for others is the best way to earn income.

2. **Focus on Strengths**  
   Concentrate your energy on what you know, what you can do, and what you have, rather than dwelling on what you don't have.

3. **Hire Others**
Learn to hire others to do things you're not good at or don't have time for, to expand your income scale. Remember, half the reward comes from ideas and courage.

4. **Act Quickly**  
   After deciding to do something, it must be completed within 72 hours, otherwise it's very likely you'll never start.

### Five, Investment Principles

1. **Avoid Gold Swallowing Beasts**  

   Bank deposits shrink due to inflation rates (e.g., 3%). According to the Rule of 72, the value of funds halves in 24 years. Stock returns are higher.

2. **Diversify Income**  
   Don't rely solely on one job, as its duration may be shorter than you imagine.

3. **Borrow Cautiously**  
   Repay as little loan as possible, retain liquidity.

4. **Funds are Better Than Individual Stocks**  
   - Funds have lower risk than individual stocks, and holding them long-term is less risky.

- Keep about 20% cash or fixed-income products to avoid the impact of market fluctuations.  
   - Invest 50% of your income monthly into funds to create a "goose laying golden eggs" passive income model.  
5. **Live within your means**  
   Learn to control spending, and ask yourself: "Is this really necessary?"

### Summary
"Money, Money, Little Dog" is not just an introductory book on finance, but also a guide on dreams, confidence, and action. Through dream albums, investment and passive income construction, we can find the path to achieve financial freedom. At the same time, the simple principles emphasized in the book remind us that wealth management is not complicated, the key lies in persistence and execution.
