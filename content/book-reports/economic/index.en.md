Professor Li Wei shares seven major models of macroeconomics. These models not only help us understand core concepts like GDP calculation, the relationship between savings and investment, and arbitrage mechanisms, but also reveal the logic behind money supply, exchange rate fluctuations, and capital flows. Through these models, ordinary people can also gain a basic understanding similar to that of an economist and comprehend the deep-seated reasons behind economic phenomena.

## What I Liked
1. **Systematic Content**: Professor Li Wei breaks down complex macroeconomic theories into seven clear models, making them easy to understand and apply.
2. **Practical Case Studies**: The theoretical models are explained in a simple yet profound way through real-world examples like the growth of foreign exchange reserves and the Federal Reserve's interest rate hikes.
3. **Highly Practical**: Both business decision-makers and general readers can learn a methodology for analyzing economic issues.
## What I Disliked
1. **Lacks Depth in Some Areas**: As this is a summary of a training course, the derivation process for some models is somewhat brief and may require further study with books.
2. **Lack of Interactivity**: As training material, it lacks practical case exercises or interactive sessions, which might affect a beginner's understanding.
## Key Takeaways
### Model One: GDP Calculation Model
The core of macroeconomics lies in the calculation of GDP, which is divided into two methods: the expenditure approach and the income approach:
- **Expenditure Approach**: GDP = C (Household Consumption) + I (Investment) + G (Government Spending) + NX (Net Exports)
  - NX = Exports - Imports
  - NX > 0 indicates a trade surplus, while NX < 0 indicates a trade deficit.
- **Income Approach**: GDP = Labor Income + Capital Income
  - Capital income includes interest, dividends, rent, and asset appreciation.
> **Key Point**: In macroeconomic models, there is no "individual," only the concept of "households." Household income comes from corporate expenses.

### Model Two: Savings and Investment Relationship Model
According to the accounting identity, savings equals investment plus net capital outflow:
- **Formula**: S = I + NX
  - S: Household Savings
  - I: Domestic Investment
  - NX: Net Exports (NCO, Net Capital Outflow)
- **Derivation**: The reason for the increase in the central bank's foreign exchange reserves is that China has long maintained a trade surplus (NX > 0), while residents and enterprises have invested less abroad.
> **Application Scenario**: Explaining the relationship between the growth of foreign exchange reserves and capital outflow.

### Model Three: Arbitrage Model
The arbitrage model is divided into real arbitrage and financial arbitrage:
1. **Real Arbitrage**:
   - The price of a commodity in China is P_China, and in the US is P_US.
   - Assuming the exchange rate is e, purchasing power parity determines the exchange rate: e = P_US / P_China.
2. **Financial Arbitrage**:
   - Assuming r_China > r_US (China's interest rate is higher than the US interest rate), investors tend to borrow US dollars to invest in China.
   - Arbitrage formula: e1 * (100/e0 * (1+r_China)) - 100 * (1 + r_US) > 0
   - If the Federal Reserve raises interest rates, leading to r_US > r_China, the pressure for the US dollar to appreciate increases.
> **Key Point**: The arbitrage window gradually disappears due to costs, risks, and policy restrictions.
---
### Model Four: Real Exchange Rate Model
The real exchange rate reflects the change in the internal and external value of a currency:
- **Formula**: E = e * CPI_domestic / CPI_foreign
  - e: Nominal exchange rate
  - CPI: Consumer Price Index
- **Impact**: When the domestic CPI rises, the RMB depreciates internally but faces appreciation pressure externally, which is unfavorable for export-oriented enterprises.
> **Application Scenario**: Analyzing the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on export-oriented enterprises.
---
### Model Five: Compound Interest Model
The compound interest model shows the speed of capital growth:
- At a 10% annual interest rate, it doubles in 7 years.
- At a 7% annual interest rate, it doubles in 10 years.
- At a 5.5% annual interest rate, it doubles in 12 years.
> **Key Point**: The compound interest effect of long-term investment is significant and suitable for personal financial planning.

### Model Six: Loanable Funds Market and Foreign Exchange Market Relationship Model
Savings, investment, and capital flows are closely related to the interest rate:
- **Relationship**:
  - S (Savings) is positively correlated with the interest rate r.
  - I (Investment) is negatively correlated with the interest rate r.
  - NCO (Net Capital Outflow) is negatively correlated with the domestic interest rate r and positively correlated with foreign interest rates.
- **Application Scenario**: Analyzing the impact of capital flight on domestic interest rates and exchange rates.
> **Conclusion**: Capital flight leads to a rise in domestic interest rates and a fall in the exchange rate.
---
### Model Seven: Money Supply Model
The money supply is determined by the monetary base and the money multiplier:
- **Formula**: Δm2 = ΔMB * MM
  - Δm2: Money Supply
  - ΔMB: Monetary Base
  - MM: Money Multiplier
- **Case Study**: Assuming the central bank expands its balance sheet by 10 billion, after multiple rounds of lending through the banking system, the final money supply can reach 50 billion (MM=5).
> **Key Point**: The central bank controls inflation by issuing government bonds or raising the reserve requirement ratio.

### Summary and Reflection
Through these seven models, we can more clearly understand the internal logic of how the macroeconomy operates. For example:
- **Growth of Foreign Exchange Reserves**: Stems from trade surpluses and capital inflows.
- **Exchange Rate Fluctuations**: Influenced by both the real exchange rate and arbitrage mechanisms.
- **Monetary Policy**: Achieves economic balance by regulating the money supply and interest rates.
> **Should ordinary people pay attention to macroeconomics?**
Macroeconomics is not just a tool for economists, but also a way of thinking for everyone to understand the world. By learning these models, we can better understand economic phenomena and make wiser decisions.
