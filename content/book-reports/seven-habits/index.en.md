Cognition is not just motivational talk, but rather the way we perceive things. By reshaping the brain, understanding probabilistic decision-making, and seizing entrepreneurial opportunities, we ultimately return to self-awareness. Combining this with "The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People," from individual success to public success, and then continuously updating, helps us find both inner motivation and external action.

- **The nature of cognition**: The cognitive reshaping and multi-dimensional perspective mentioned in the book made me re-examine my own way of thinking.

- **The systematic nature of habits**: The seven habits present a clear and progressive logic from individual to public success.

- **Highly practical**: Each habit provides specific methodologies, such as "Begin with the End in Mind" and "Win-Win Thinking."

- **Preconceived notions**: Initially thought it was just motivational fluff, leading to missing out on its value for years. In reality, the content is very practical.

## What I Liked

- **Some concepts are abstract**: For example, "Synergy" requires more case studies for better understanding.
### I. The Power of Cognition

1. **The Nature of Cognition**  

   Cognition is the way you perceive things; everyone's way of thinking determines their unique worldview. As with Munger's multi-dimensional grid model, different perspectives bring different insights.
2. **Reshaping the Brain**  
## What I Disliked
   
   Zhang Chaozhong believes the brain can be reshaped; through self-suggestion and deliberate practice, we can change our behavioral patterns and ways of thinking.
3. **Probability and Uncertainty**  

   Yanping Duan proposed that life decisions are a probability problem, while Taleb emphasized the uncertainty of the world. Seeking certainty in uncertainty is precisely the core of cognition.
4. **Cognition in Entrepreneurship**  

## Key Takeaways 
   Entrepreneurship is a way to obtain passive income. Everyone has a different cognition of entrepreneurship, but the key lies in seizing one's own cognitive opportunities and finding a path suitable for oneself.

#### 2. Start with the End in Mind

- **Discovering Strengths**: Identify yourself through three questions: What do you enjoy doing? What are you good at? In what kind of environment do you feel most comfortable?
- **Internal Points Card**: Buffett advocates focusing on intrinsic evaluation rather than external recognition.
#### 3. First Things First

- **Self-Management**: Includes attention management, goal management, and time management.
- **Priority in the Second Quadrant**: Focus on important but not urgent tasks, avoiding getting trapped in urgent and important crises.
- **Authorization Model**: Shift from directive authorization to responsibility-based authorization, clarifying expected outcomes, guidelines, available resources, etc.
