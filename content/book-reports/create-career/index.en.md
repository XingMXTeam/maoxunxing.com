## What I Disliked

## Key Takeaways

### Minimalist Cognition

#### How to Start
- **Digital Content**: Sell knowledge through videos, e-books, podcasts, and courses (like Lynda.com).
- **Physical Products**: Selling innovative products (such as glowing electronic vests) on platforms like Kickstarter.
- **Connecting Services**: Offering intermediary services, charging fixed fees or percentage-based fees (such as Craigslist).
- **SaaS**: Developing software that solves specific problems (such as Festival asynchronous voice messaging app).

These business types can be categorized into four types of utility:
- **Time utility**: Saving time or improving efficiency.
- **Form utility**: Changing the form or function of a product.
- **Possession utility**: Transferring ownership of items to those who need them.
- **Place utility**: Moving products to places where there is greater demand.

#### Action Guide

1. **Action Speaks Louder Than Words**: Ideas are worthless; what matters is starting.
2. **Master the Right Mindset**: No book can cover everything; the key is learning how to start and develop a business.
3. **Consumer-Focused**: Choose fields with fast feedback and plenty of iteration opportunities, such as SaaS, digital products, or connecting services.
### Customer Validation

1. **Rapid Prototyping**: Utilize modern tools to conduct customer validation with minimal cost, avoiding leading questions.

2. **Niche Market First**: Choose a market of moderate size with less competition and where customers are willing to pay.

3. **Discovery over Implementation**: Creating a product is a discovery process, while technology is the application of science.
4. **Effective Quantum**: At least enable some users to do things they couldn't do before.
Example: Gumroad initially had only 2700 lines of code, manually handling payments and file uploads, but it solved the core problems.
### Productization

1. **Digital products are never ready**: The key is to solve problems and make customers willing to pay.

---

2. **Like + Monetization + Growth Value**: Choose a direction that interests you and can be monetized.

3. **Pricing Strategy**: Unless it's an ad model, it must be charged. Prices can be adjusted based on demand, or even define higher tiers for super users.
4. **Aesthetics is Not Key**: Customers are willing to pay even with flaws (like Craigslist).
## Sales
1. **Customers are the business model**: Grow together with customers, identify problems, and improve the fit between products and the market.

2. **Sales start with discussing problems**: Share your stories and values to attract like-minded people.

---

3. **Output values**: Like-minded people will find you and collaborate with you.
4. **Community teaching**: Regularly share knowledge, inspire ideas, and gain an in-depth understanding of customer needs.
5. **Learn from Customers**: Customers' attention is a sign of trust, don't waste it.
6. **Post-Marketing Reflections**: You don't need complex marketing for the first 100 customers; focus on one high-quality channel.
7. **Early growth relies on manual sales, later on word-of-mouth**.
8. **Repeat customers are key**: Ensure time and resources are allocated to expand new businesses.
9. **Review Failures**: Transform every failure into insight.
10. **Small and Reliable Customers Are More Important**: Like Mailchimp focusing on small business customers.
11. **Customers Are the Business Plan**: Embrace customer education and focus on customer needs.
