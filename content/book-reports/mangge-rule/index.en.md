"Munger's Way" records Charlie Munger's remarks at the shareholders' meeting, covering his investment philosophy, principles of conduct, and life wisdom. The book emphasizes the core concept of value investing while providing profound insights from the 多元思维模型 (multiple intelligences model) and life guidance.

- **Profound Investment Philosophy**: Munger's value investment philosophy is clear and understandable, especially the core idea that "buying stocks is buying a company," which leaves a deep impression.

- **Diverse Thinking Models**: The interdisciplinary approach mentioned in the book (such as psychology, economics) provides a brand-new perspective for investment decisions and life choices.

- **Real Case Studies**: Through actual investment cases (such as railroad companies, The Wall Street Journal), it demonstrates how to identify good businesses and competitive advantages.
## What I Liked

- **Content Slightly Repetitive**: As it is a transcript of a shareholders' meeting, some parts of the content may seem repetitive or overly detailed, requiring patience to filter out the key points while reading.

- **Highly professional**: For beginners, some financial indicators and investment terms may require additional learning to be fully understood.

1. **Core of value investing**:
   - Buying at a reasonable price with intrinsic value exceeding the price is value investing.

   - A good business should have long-term competitive advantages and does not require huge investment to maintain these advantages.

2. **The Key to Success**:

---
   - Success is not accidental but the result of putting heart into one's actions and deeds. In a lifetime, a person may have about 2-3 good opportunities; seizing them can change one's destiny.
## What I Disliked

3. **Investment and Circle of Competence**:
   - Investments should be made within one's circle of competence, avoiding areas of uncertainty.

- Munger suggests investing in less crowded places (like the Chinese market) because there may be undervalued opportunities.
4. **Importance of Financial Indicators**:
---

   - Focus on Return on Equity (ROE) and Net Cash Flow.
## Key Takeaways
   - Companies with net cash flow greater than net profit are more worth investing in, indicating they have sufficient cash annually for reinvestment.

5. **The Dynamism of Moats**:
   - Moats can disappear over time, such as the newspaper industry declining due to the rise of the internet.
   - However, certain industries (like railroads) may become more attractive due to reduced competition.

6. **Long-term Investment Strategy**:
- Investing in stocks is a long-term endeavor; short-term speculation is difficult to sustain profits.
   - Growing alongside excellent companies in the long term (such as "Fifty Finest" stocks) is a sound strategy.

7. **Human Nature and Market Inefficiency**:
   - Markets are usually efficient, but they may fail due to human weaknesses.
- Determining market failure requires combining multiple thinking models, such as psychological biases.

8. **Standards for Good Business**:
   - A good business is a pattern that is immediately clear, such as lawyers needing to purchase newspapers for legal notice services.

9. **Discounted Cash Flow Method**:
- Good prices can be calculated through the discounting of future cash flows, for example, future net profit of 1000 yuan discounted at an 8% rate is 925.93 yuan.

10. **Stay away from poor quality**:
    - Stay away from gambling and dishonest people, maintain integrity, honesty, and kindness.

11. **The importance of reverse thinking**:
- Always think in reverse, for example, to become an excellent person, just avoid doing a few wrong things.

12. **Focus and Deep Thinking**:
    - Mastering one problem is more valuable than superficially understanding 100 problems.

13. **The Advantage of Time**:
- Youth is an advantage in investment because time can amplify the effect of compounding.

14. **Choosing Excellent Partners**:
    - Choose a wife or partner who is smarter than you, provided that you are also sufficiently excellent.

15. **The Necessity of Checklists**:
- Before investing, establish a checklist to ensure alignment with your own mental models and principles.

16. **Risk of Cash Depreciation**:
    - Cash is an inevitable form of depreciation, so high-quality equity should be prioritized.

17. **Lower Expectations, Enhance Happiness**:
- Don't try to educate others; lowering expectations can lead to greater happiness.

18. **Making Friends and Learning**:
    - Life requires 2-3 close friends to exchange ideas and learn together, avoiding working in isolation.

19. **Active Funds vs. Index Funds**:
- Active funds struggle to outperform index funds due to management fee issues, so most people should choose low-cost index funds.

20. **Role of Macro Models**:
    - Macro models help in understanding how the world works, but they should not be the primary basis for investment decisions.
